This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic\nNLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for\nincremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and\ninterpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along\nwith symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid\nmethod works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline."}

To adapt the model for the\noutput format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document\nreconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,\nit further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a\nfraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward\nhigher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on\nparticularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex\nprompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small\nlanguage models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much\nlarger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant\nimprovements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate\ncandidates further improves both performance and generalization."}

Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by\nmarginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.\n  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a\ntext, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling.

We propose \\emph{Hint-Engineering}, a\nnew data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal\npoints within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,\ncode-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI\ninteraction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to\npost-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised\nfine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI\nusage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement\nlearning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,\nyielding absolute improvements of 4\\% and 8\\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B\nand DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging\nmathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances\nefficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\\% for the 32B model and\n50\\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.\nThe models and code are available at: https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT."}

To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual\ndescriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not\nduring deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation\ncue always means that it is being tested.

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity).

This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus.

Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not\none fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework\nthat decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and\ndiversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,\ndivergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty\nevaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.\nWe evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on\nCreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different\nmetrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary\nand open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly\ncorrelated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different\ndomains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong\ncorrelations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -\nwhereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either.

To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally.

Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural\nlanguage processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models\npossess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,\nstarting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional\nCuriosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework\nthat covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social\nCuriosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results\ndemonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but\nstill tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.\nWe further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of\nLLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and\nactive learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential\nto exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support\nfor the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in\nLLMs."}

When presented with non-English\nquestions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about\ninterpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We\nsystematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the\nquestion. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond\nmeasuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the\nreasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially\nhigher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English\ngenerally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap\nincreasing as tasks become more complex.

We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel\nrepresentations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates\nat fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where\nuncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination\nprobability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \\leq\nf(\\sigma^2((1-\\rho(P))/P + \\rho(P)), \\mu^2)$, which predicts that language\nmodels need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce\nND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA\nadapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces\nhallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general\naccuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,\ncausal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and\ncorrelational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is\nassociated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent\noptimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal\nneurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third\naxis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the\nreliability of language models at fixed budgets."}

In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility."}

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning\nunderperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and\nClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods\nserved as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in\ntoxicities.\n  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine\nlearning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small\ntraining data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare\ncategories.\n  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine\ntreatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong\npotential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance."}
