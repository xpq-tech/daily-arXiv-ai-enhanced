### [1] [MTEB-NL and E5-NL: Embedding Benchmark and Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12340)
*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对荷兰语在嵌入资源中的代表性不足问题，提出了MTEB-NL基准测试、训练数据集和E5-NL嵌入模型系列，以促进荷兰语嵌入技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足，通常只占已发布资源的一小部分，需要专门的资源来支持荷兰语嵌入模型的评估和开发。

Method: 1) 创建MTEB-NL荷兰语基准测试，包含现有和新创建的数据集；2) 编译荷兰语检索数据集并利用大语言模型生成合成数据；3) 开发紧凑高效的E5-NL嵌入模型系列。

Result: 提供了完整的荷兰语嵌入评估资源，包括基准测试、训练数据和预训练模型，这些资源在Hugging Face Hub和MTEB包中公开可用。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了荷兰语嵌入资源的空白，为荷兰语NLP社区提供了重要的基础设施，有望推动荷兰语嵌入技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [2] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事构建的人类验证基准，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现即使大型模型也容易受到对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，研究重点转向评估其复杂抽象推理和推理能力，特别是基于文学作品的深层理解技能。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，采用多项选择题形式测试道德推理，并设计对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但对对抗性操作敏感，约20%的情况下会自相矛盾。推理增强模型未能改善性能，表明规模而非推理能力是主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，主要依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，需要更深入的评估方法来测试其真实理解能力。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382)
*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究使用LLM作为评估者来评估法律检索增强生成系统，发现传统评估指标在AI系统评估中存在误导性，提出Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数作为更可靠的评估指标，以及Wilcoxon符号秩检验用于系统比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统评估指标无法捕捉法律研究等专业领域的细微质量维度，需要研究LLM是否能够作为可靠的评估者来评估同类系统。

Method: 通过系统实验研究两个基本问题：哪种评估者间可靠性指标最能捕捉LLM与人类评估的一致性，以及如何进行统计上可靠的系统比较。

Result: 发现传统一致性指标如Krippendorff's alpha在AI系统评估的偏态分布中具有误导性，Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数更适合评估者选择，Wilcoxon符号秩检验配合Benjamini-Hochberg校正提供了可靠的系统比较方法。

Conclusion: 研究为法律应用提供了一条可扩展、成本效益高的评估路径，将传统人力密集型评估瓶颈转变为自动化且统计原理严谨的评估框架。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### [4] [SENTRA: Selected-Next-Token Transformer for LLM Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12385)
*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SENTRA检测器，基于Transformer编码器和对比预训练，在跨域文本检测中显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强和普及，其被滥用的风险增加，需要检测未声明的LLM生成文本

Method: 使用selected-next-token-probability序列的Transformer编码器，在大规模无标注数据上进行对比预训练

Result: 在3个公开数据集、24个文本领域的实验中，在跨域设置下显著优于流行基线方法

Conclusion: SENTRA是一个通用的分类器，能有效检测LLM生成的文本

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [5] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORQA是一个新的多语言医疗问答基准测试，用于评估自然语言生成系统在医疗领域的性能，发现基于大语言模型的评估方法显著优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的自然语言生成评估面临独特挑战，传统自动评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，特别是在开放式医疗问答任务中可能存在多个有效回答。

Method: 构建MORQA多语言基准测试，包含英语和中文的医疗视觉和文本问答数据集，每个问题有2-4个以上医学专家编写的黄金标准答案和专家人工评分。对比评估传统指标和基于大语言模型（GPT-4、Gemini）的评估方法。

Result: 基于大语言模型的评估方法在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，能够更好地捕捉语义细微差别并对参考答案的变异性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了医疗领域NLG评估的首个全面多语言定性研究，强调需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### [6] [MedFact: Benchmarking the Fact-Checking Capabilities of Large Language Models on Chinese Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440)
*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MedFact基准测试，用于评估中文医疗事实核查，包含2116个专家标注实例，涵盖13个医学专业和8种错误类型，发现LLMs在错误定位方面存在挑战，并存在过度批评现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在医疗领域的数据范围有限，无法捕捉真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要更严格的评估标准来确保LLM在医疗应用中的事实可靠性。

Method: 采用混合AI-人类框架构建MedFact基准，通过迭代专家反馈优化AI驱动的多标准筛选过程，包含2116个专家标注实例，涵盖13个医学专业、8种错误类型、4种写作风格和多个难度级别。

Result: 评估了20个领先LLM，发现模型虽然能判断文本是否包含错误，但精确定位错误仍是重大挑战，顶级模型性能仍不及人类专家，还发现过度批评现象（将正确信息误判为错误）。

Conclusion: MedFact为开发更事实可靠和医学感知的模型提供了强大资源，突显了在医疗应用中部署LLM的关键挑战，特别是错误定位和过度批评问题。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [7] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicK是一个基于主题覆盖的检索框架，通过识别测试输入所需的细粒度知识主题并评估模型对这些主题的知识掌握程度，迭代选择能够覆盖模型知识盲区的演示示例，从而提升上下文学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率来检索演示示例，这往往导致选择到不相关或冗余的例子。关键在于需要识别并全面覆盖细粒度的知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计测试输入所需的主题；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入先前未覆盖且模型知识水平较低的主题的演示示例。

Result: 在多个数据集和各种开源及闭源大语言模型上进行了广泛实验，验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的方式有效提升了上下文学习中演示示例的选择质量，解决了传统方法中存在的相关性和冗余性问题。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

### [8] [Does Language Model Understand Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459)
*Suvojit Acharjee,Utathya Aich,Asfak Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估SOTA语言模型在英语和孟加拉语中处理时态、否定、语态等精细语言现象的能力，发现Compound-Beta模型在跨语言场景中与人类判断最一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，需要确保其与人类语言理解的一致性，特别是在联合国SDG 4强调语言清晰度的教育背景下

Method: 使用新提出的LUCID数据集（包含英语和孟加拉语的精心构造句子对），采用标准指标（Pearson/Spearman相关系数、MAE）和新颖的HCE准确度指标评估多个SOTA模型

Result: Compound-Beta表现最均衡，在英语中取得最高Pearson相关系数，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，显示出与人类判断的强一致性

Conclusion: 语言模型在处理精细语言现象时仍需改进，Compound-Beta在跨语言场景中与人类判断最接近，为教育技术中的LM部署提供了重要参考

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

*Sumanta Bhattacharyya,Sara Riaz,Pedram Rooshenas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过提炼LLM的推理轨迹来训练任务专用的小型推理模型，解决了高质量标签稀缺的问题，在数据库设计评估任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺时，训练任务专用的小型推理模型具有挑战性。但具备推理能力的LLM能够产生丰富的中间推理轨迹，可以系统性地提炼这些轨迹来创建有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 使用开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高质量数据集；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，使模型的中间推理与人工验证的概念偏好对齐。

Result: 在扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务中，使用包含600个变体的数据集（450训练/150测试），涵盖11个错误类别。实证评估表明R2tA为数据稀缺领域的可扩展LLM适应提供了实用且经济高效的路径。

Conclusion: R2tA方法能够实现可复现的AI工具，适用于教育等领域，特别是在结构复杂的任务中，纯提示方法容易遗漏或产生幻觉错误的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR是一个基于大语言模型的大规模语音识别系统，通过数据扩展、模型扩展、LLM集成和强化学习的协同组合，在复杂语音识别场景中实现最先进性能，并针对实际部署进行了优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ASR领域在数据扩展、模型扩展和LLM集成方面取得了显著进展，但LLM容易产生幻觉问题，这会严重影响实际ASR应用的用户体验。现有LLM-based ASR系统在开源基准上表现良好，但在真实工业评估集上往往表现不佳。

Method: FunAudio-ASR系统结合了大规模数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，并针对流式处理能力、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行了专门优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，FunAudio-ASR在真实应用数据集上实现了SOTA性能，证明了其在实践环境中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR通过生产导向的优化，成功解决了LLM-based ASR系统在实际部署中的性能下降问题，为实际ASR应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较三种Bambara语机器翻译流水线：简单Transformer、LLaMA3微调、LaBSE语言蒸馏。简单Transformer在低资源环境下表现最佳，达到10% BLEU和21% chrF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非洲曼德语系的Bambara语（约1418万使用者）开发有效的机器翻译系统，解决低资源语言翻译的挑战。

Method: 1) 训练简单Transformer进行法语到Bambara翻译；2) 微调LLaMA3指导模型；3) 使用师生网络语言蒸馏整合Bambara到LaBSE预训练模型。

Result: 简单Transformer流水线表现最佳：Bayelemagaba数据集上10% BLEU和21% chrF，Yiri数据集上33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。指导模型在单一数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言Bambara，简单的Transformer架构比复杂的指导模型和语言蒸馏方法更有效，在翻译准确性方面表现最优。

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本自动音频字幕生成系统，利用预训练模型避免大量训练，通过音频CLIP模型提取特征并生成结构化提示来指导大语言模型生成字幕，相比传统方法在NLG评分上提升35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动音频字幕生成面临数据集有限的问题，相比图像字幕生成数据量不足，需要开发不依赖大量训练数据的方法

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征并生成结构化提示，指导大语言模型进行字幕生成，通过音频CLIP模型优化token选择确保与音频内容对齐

Result: 实验结果显示NLG平均得分从4.7提升到7.3，提升35%（使用MAGIC搜索和WavCaps模型），性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择影响显著

Conclusion: 零样本方法在自动音频字幕生成中表现优异，单关键词提示效果最佳，无关键词列表时性能下降50%，证明了预训练模型在该任务中的有效性

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

TL;DR: 本文提出EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样性并行强化学习，在自动定理证明任务中仅用12%计算成本达到与基线相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在自动定理证明中采用测试时扩展策略（如反射式CoT推理和增加采样次数）带来显著计算开销，且现有成本分析忽视不同策略带来的采样成本差异

Method: 提出两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样性并行强化学习配合可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提升通过率

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验显示，EconProver仅需基线方法12%的计算成本就能达到相当性能

Conclusion: 该工作为部署轻量级自动定理证明模型提供了可行方案，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

*Yu,Wang,Sheng Shen,Rémi Munos,Hongyuan Zhan,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoPE存在距离依赖偏差限制长上下文建模能力，TAPA通过可学习相位函数改进位置编码，在长上下文任务上表现优于RoPE系列方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) 在长上下文建模中存在固有的距离依赖偏差问题，现有扩展方法需要预训练后调整，存在局限性

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中引入可学习相位函数，保持长距离token交互，支持直接轻量微调扩展到更长上下文

Result: TAPA能够外推到未见长度，在长上下文任务上获得显著更低的困惑度，优于RoPE系列方法

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的位置编码改进方法，解决了RoPE的长上下文建模限制，具有更好的扩展性和性能表现

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出发音感知上下文框架(PAC)，通过两阶段学习方法解决LLM-based ASR中的发音建模和同音词区分问题，显著降低词错误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中发音建模效果不佳和同音词区分困难的问题，这对于原始词和长尾词的识别至关重要

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1)发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错字素-音素上下文建模策略；2)发音区分性强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强模型区分同音词能力

Result: 在英文Librispeech和中文AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-based ASR模型，相对词错误率分别降低30.2%和53.8%；长尾词的偏置词错误率相对降低31.8%和60.5%

Conclusion: PAC框架有效解决了LLM-based ASR中的发音建模和同音词区分挑战，显著提升了识别性能，特别是在长尾词识别方面表现突出

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测大语言模型意识形态偏见的方法，通过分析模型输出在相关主题提示下的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控，适用于黑盒系统的审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数百万用户产品中的广泛应用，其输出可能影响个人信念和公共舆论。如果模型可以被有意引导至特定意识形态立场，控制者可能对公共话语产生不成比例的影响。

Method: 采用先前提出的统计方法，适应意识形态偏见审计的新背景。该方法具有模型无关性，不需要访问语言模型内部结构，而是通过分析模型在相关主题提示下输出的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其实际适用性和支持对大语言模型行为进行独立事后审计的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型意识形态操控提供了有效的工具，特别适合对专有黑盒系统进行审计，有助于确保语言模型的公正性和透明度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的双奖励函数方法，通过识别LLM在策略规划中的知识边界，同时优化准确性和基于熵的置信度，有效缓解了情感支持对话中的策略偏好偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和特定策略偏好偏差的问题，现有方法虽然通过微调策略规划器显示了一定潜力，但LLM偏好偏差的根本原因尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 首先揭示LLM在策略规划中的知识边界作为偏差的根本原因，然后提出基于强化学习的双奖励函数方法，根据知识边界通过准确性和基于熵的置信度来优化策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上使用多个LLM骨干网络的实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过识别知识边界并采用双奖励强化学习，成功缓解了LLM在情感支持对话中的策略偏好偏差，提高了策略规划的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出MTG和MTI两个互补模块，构建无需人工标注的文本行人搜索框架，通过多轮对话生成伪标签和优化查询，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本行人搜索中高质量文本标注获取困难的问题，传统方法需要大量人工标注，限制了系统的可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: MTG模块通过与多模态大语言模型模拟对话生成丰富的伪标签；MTI模块在推理时通过动态对话式推理优化用户查询，处理模糊、不完整或歧义的描述。

Result: 在广泛评估中实现了竞争性或更优的结果，同时消除了对人工标注的需求，显著提高了检索准确性、鲁棒性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本行人搜索系统的可扩展和实际部署铺平了道路，提供了一个统一且无需标注的框架。

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

*Shaz Furniturewala,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出基于机制解释性技术的新策略，通过识别毒性分类器中的脆弱组件来提升对抗攻击下的性能，发现不同人口群体存在不同的脆弱头机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的在线内容激增，传统基于人类文本训练的毒性分类器面临误分类问题，现有防御策略被动且效果有限，需要主动识别脆弱组件。

Method: 使用微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，通过对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，然后抑制这些脆弱电路来提升性能，并在多个少数群体数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或对攻击脆弱的特定头，抑制脆弱头可改善对抗输入性能，不同人口群体的脆弱头机制存在差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能提高毒性检测模型的鲁棒性，为开发更具包容性的毒性检测模型提供人口层面的洞察，揭示了模型训练中的公平性和鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于案例的决策理论（CBDT）解码方法，通过使用领域数据样本来估计期望效用，解决了MBR解码在处理域外知识时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以准确捕获域外知识或信息，需要一种更好的方法来处理这一问题。

Method: 提出CBDT解码方法，利用领域数据样本来估计期望效用，并与MBR解码相结合使用。

Result: 在7个领域De-En和Ja↔En翻译任务以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像字幕任务中，MBR与CBDT组合的解码方法优于单独的MBR解码。

Conclusion: CBDT解码不仅能生成比MAP解码更高质量的文本，而且与MBR解码结合使用时能进一步提升性能，特别是在处理域外知识方面表现更好。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间推理数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且更关注当代事件，需要构建一个全面的多语言历史事件数据库和评估基准来推动时间推理研究。

Method: 从维基百科时间线页面和文章信息框中提取历史事件，构建包含10种语言的10M+事件数据库，并设计6种时间QA任务来评估LLMs性能。

Result: GPT4o在所有答案类型和语言中表现最佳，Gemma-2在小型语言模型中表现最优。数据库提供了前所未有的历史深度和语言广度覆盖。

Conclusion: HistoryBank为推进多语言和时间感知的自然语言理解提供了全面资源，将促进历史事件时间推理研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型是否具备人类般的概念抽象能力，以及如何通过编码图像中的高级概念信息来增强这种能力

Method: 构建MAGIC分组图像-标题数据集，使用新颖的分组对比损失函数（外部对比损失和内部损失），通过对比学习使模型学习图像-标题组的共同信息

Result: 实验表明该方法在抽象概念识别方面相比最先进模型有所提升，模型能够在不接触高级概念标签的情况下获得概念抽象能力

Conclusion: 提出的分组对比学习方法成功使视觉语言模型具备了概念抽象能力，这种能力是作为训练过程中的涌现特性出现的

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有"自上而下"方法在生成假设或大纲后再检索证据，容易导致模型计划与可用知识脱节，造成内容碎片化和事实不准确。需要一种能够严格约束生成内容、确保可追溯性的方法。

Method: 采用"检索优先获取知识，聚类构建结构"策略：1）从知识库进行详尽迭代检索；2）使用无监督聚类算法将检索文档组织成"知识簇"；3）基于这些簇生成层次化大纲和最终文档内容。

Result: 在14B和32B参数模型上的实验表明，该方法达到或超过最先进基线性能，在需要高保真度和结构连贯性的知识约束场景中展现出独特优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成可靠、结构化长文档提供了有效范式，为高风险、知识密集型领域中的LLM应用铺平了道路，从根本上减轻了幻觉风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Motivation: 马耳他语作为受罗曼语和日耳曼语影响的独特闪族语言，其拉丁字母正字法与阿拉伯语等近亲存在差距，研究能否利用阿拉伯语资源来增强马耳他语NLP

Method: 采用多种策略对齐阿拉伯语和马耳他语文本数据，包括不同音译方案和机器翻译方法，并引入了新的能更好表示马耳他语正字法的音译系统

Result: 阿拉伯语基础的增强方法能显著有益于马耳他语NLP任务，在单语和多语模型上都表现出性能提升

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语资源可以通过跨语言增强技术有效支持马耳他语NLP，证明了语言相似性在资源稀缺语言处理中的重要性

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 多媒体内容的激增需要有效的多媒体事件抽取系统，但大型视觉语言模型在此任务上的应用潜力尚未得到充分探索

Method: 在M2E2数据集上评估代表性LVLMs，涵盖文本、图像和跨媒体子任务，采用少样本提示和LoRA微调两种设置

Result: 少样本LVLMs在视觉任务表现更好但文本任务困难；LoRA微调显著提升性能；跨模态组合展现强协同效应

Conclusion: LVLMs在多媒体事件抽取中展现潜力，但在语义精度、定位和跨模态基础方面仍存在挑战

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效准确的LLM问题难度估计方案，无需额外计算开销，为自适应推理提供了有效指导

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Conclusion: 通过从零开始训练、引入软掩码机制和动态硬负样本挖掘，Conan-embedding-v2成功解决了LLM与嵌入模型之间的差距问题，在文本嵌入任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Motivation: 现有置信度估计方法主要针对事实问答任务，在推理任务上泛化能力不足，需要专门针对推理任务的置信度估计方案。

Method: 将推理路径建模为有向图，利用图的中心性、路径收敛性和路径加权等属性进行置信度估计，无需训练。

Result: 在两个大语言模型和三个推理数据集上的实验表明，该方法在置信度估计和下游任务性能上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 图基置信度估计方法能有效提升大语言模型在推理任务上的可靠性，为模型部署提供更好的置信度评估工具。

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出端到端框架，通过挖掘全文论文自动生成结构化研究流程图，在NLP领域验证效果显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能提取碎片化流程组件，无法捕捉完整研究流程，需要自动化生成可重现的研究工作流

Method: 段落中心方法：PU学习识别流程描述段落→Flan-T5生成流程短语→ChatGPT分类→可视化流程图生成

Result: 段落识别F1=0.9772，短语生成ROUGE-1=0.4543，分类精度=0.958，成功分析NLP领域20年方法演变

Conclusion: 提供了自动化工作流生成的技术框架和过程导向视角，有助于科学范式演变的实证研究

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA在小型语言模型(11M-66M参数)预训练中的系统研究表明，其性能通常不如标准训练，且模型越大差距越明显，低秩更新策略可能不适用于SLM预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLoRA方法在小型语言模型(SLMs)预训练中的应用效果，探索参数高效方法在低计算成本环境下的可行性。

Method: 通过消融实验系统评估ReLoRA在11M-66M参数SLMs上的性能表现和学习动态，比较损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标。

Result: ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP评估中普遍表现不如标准训练，且随着模型规模增大性能差距扩大，分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型的秩缺陷问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能难以直接迁移到小型语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算环境下进行更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了跨文化葡萄酒评论适应问题，通过构建首个中英平行语料库，评估了神经机器翻译和大型语言模型在文化敏感翻译中的表现，发现现有模型难以捕捉文化细微差别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的发展为文化感知语言任务提供了可能，但现有翻译模型在处理文化内容时存在局限性，特别是在葡萄酒评论这种需要融入地域口味偏好和文化特定风味描述的场景中。

Method: 构建了包含8k中文和16k英文专业评论的平行语料库，使用神经机器翻译基线和最先进的大型语言模型进行基准测试，提出了三个文化导向的评估标准（文化亲近性、文化中立性、文化真实性）进行人工评估。

Result: 分析表明当前模型在捕捉文化细微差别方面存在困难，特别是在跨文化翻译葡萄酒描述时表现不佳，突显了翻译模型在处理文化内容时的挑战和局限。

Conclusion: 跨文化葡萄酒评论适应是一个具有挑战性的问题，现有翻译技术尚不能很好地处理文化敏感内容，需要进一步研究来提升模型的文化感知能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐姿监测系统识别粒度粗糙，缺乏语义表达能力，无法提供个性化反馈，导致长期肌肉骨骼疾病和生理功能障碍

Method: 包含三个核心模块：高斯鲁棒传感器嵌入模块（空间分块和局部噪声扰动）、提示驱动的跨模态对齐模块（通过多头交叉注意力将传感器嵌入重编程到LLM语义空间）、多上下文提示模块（融合特征级、结构级、统计级和语义级上下文信息）

Result: 实现了细粒度坐姿理解和个性化健康导向的响应生成

Conclusion: SitLLM框架通过多模态融合和LLM的语义理解能力，显著提升了坐姿监测的精度和个性化反馈质量

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域应用受限，主要因为领域特定训练数据稀缺且复杂，需要寻找更经济高效的解决方案

Method: 通过多模型生成（GPT-4o和o3-mini）将32亿条AIS船舶追踪记录转换为21,543个合成问答对，用于微调Qwen2.5-7B模型

Result: 微调后的模型在海事任务上达到75%准确率，成本比使用大型模型进行推理大幅降低

Conclusion: 通过适当微调，较小、更便宜的模型可以提供与昂贵大型模型相似的准确率，为专业AI应用的合成数据集生成提供了可复现框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

TL;DR: 提出使用小型编码器变换器作为语义奖励模型，在GRPO框架中改进LLM生成解释的质量，相比传统方法能更好地捕捉语义本质


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成符合复杂定性目标（如教学合理性）的输出方面存在挑战，传统强化学习方法依赖缓慢的LLM评估或脆弱的基于关键词的指标，无法捕捉高质量解释的语义本质

Method: 在GRPO框架中使用小型高效的编码器变换器作为语义奖励模型，基于生成解释与真实参考之间的余弦相似度提供密集的语义丰富奖励信号

Result: 在意大利医学院入学考试任务中，该方法显著提高了解释的忠实性和清晰度，优于强大的监督微调基线

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编码器模型进行细致奖励塑形在复杂生成任务中具有强大潜力，能够指导策略生成不仅事实正确而且在结构和概念上与专家推理一致的解释

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

TL;DR: PLAP框架通过语言规划+参数执行的方法，解决了LLM智能体在长时域对抗环境中的落地问题，在MicroRTS游戏中表现出色，超越了80%的基线智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体方法存在两个问题：直接生成底层动作不可靠，而高层任务规划又依赖专家经验来转换为具体动作序列。需要一种既能利用LLM规划能力又能可靠执行的方法。

Method: 提出PLAP框架：1）包含环境特定参数化技能的技能库；2）LLM驱动的技能规划器；3）将参数化技能转换为可执行动作序列的技能执行器。

Result: GPT-4o驱动的PLAP在零样本设置下超越80%基线智能体，Qwen2-72B驱动的PLAP在少量样本下超越了顶级脚本智能体CoacAI。建立了LLM长时域技能规划能力排行榜。

Conclusion: PLAP框架有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂长时域环境中的落地挑战，通过分离语言规划和参数执行，实现了可靠的环境交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD是一种基于隐藏信号分析和傅里叶变换的幻觉检测新方法，通过建模自回归生成过程中的时序动态，在多个基准测试中比现有方法提升10个百分点以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，效果和鲁棒性有限

Method: HSAD框架通过采样各层激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用自回归特性确定最佳观测点

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比之前的最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现过度提示（over-prompting）现象：在大型语言模型中使用过多领域特定示例反而会降低性能，挑战了传统少样本学习的认知。通过多种选择方法和多个LLM的实验，确定了最优示例数量，在软件需求分类任务上超越现有方法1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究over-prompting现象，即过多的提示示例反而导致LLM性能下降的问题，挑战传统少样本学习认为更多相关示例总是有益的认知。

Method: 使用三种少样本选择方法（随机采样、语义嵌入、TF-IDF向量）构建提示框架，在多个LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-3.5-turbo等）上进行实验，逐步增加TF-IDF选择的分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量。

Result: 实验发现过度添加领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，确定了每个LLM的最优示例数量，在软件功能和非功能需求分类任务上比现有最佳方法提升1%准确率。

Conclusion: 少样本示例数量存在最优值，过度提示会损害性能，结合TF-IDF和分层选择的方法可以用更少示例获得更好效果，为LLM提示工程提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

TL;DR: LLM在人格特质评估方面表现有限，与真实人格特质的相关系数低于0.26，提示当前模型在心理学理解方面仍有不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在情感支持和决策辅助等需要心理理解的应用中部署增多，需要评估其在生态有效对话环境中解释人类人格特质的能力

Method: 使用包含半结构化访谈记录和连续Big Five特质分数的基准数据集，评估三种方法：零样本和思维链提示、LoRA微调、以及使用预训练嵌入的回归分析

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质的Pearson相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提示提升有限

Conclusion: 当前LLM与验证心理学构念的对齐程度有限，人格推断更多依赖潜在语义表征而非显式推理，需要未来在特质特定提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向微调方面的工作

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Motivation: 图表是重要的信息可视化媒介，但现有大型视觉语言模型在图表问答任务中经常关注不相关区域，导致性能受限。通过分析人类注视模式来改进模型的注意力机制。

Method: 构建ChartGaze眼动追踪数据集，捕获人类在图表推理任务中的注视模式；提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，将图像-文本注意力与人类注视点对齐。

Conclusion: 人类注视信息的引入可以有效提升图表导向LVLMs的推理质量和可解释性，展示了将人类认知模式融入模型优化的重要价值。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: AgentScaler框架通过自动构建异构模拟环境来扩展函数调用场景，采用两阶段微调策略提升大语言模型的agentic智能，在多个基准测试中显著增强了函数调用能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界API需要精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，而agent能力的广度与训练环境的多样性密切相关。为了推进通用agent智能，需要解决如何规模化环境和如何从环境交互中有效训练agent能力这两个核心挑战

Method: 设计可扩展框架自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，系统性地拓宽函数调用场景空间；采用两阶段agent微调策略：先赋予基础agent能力，再进行领域特定专业化

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等agent基准测试上的广泛实验表明，训练的AgentScaler模型显著增强了模型的函数调用能力

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境和有效的两阶段训练策略，AgentScaler成功提升了agentic智能，为实际应用中的大语言模型部署提供了重要基础

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: WebWeaver是一个双智能体框架，通过模拟人类研究过程来解决开放深度研究问题，采用动态规划和分层检索写作方法，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放深度研究方法存在静态研究流程和一次性生成范式的双重限制，导致长上下文失败问题和幻觉问题，需要更接近人类研究过程的解决方案

Method: 引入双智能体框架：规划器动态循环迭代证据获取和提纲优化，生成基于证据的全面提纲；写作者执行分层检索和写作过程，逐部分撰写报告

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 自适应规划和聚焦式合成对于生成高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要，验证了以人为中心的迭代方法论的有效性

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum是一种新的范式，通过定期上下文摘要克服LLM网络代理的上下文窗口限制，实现无限探索，平均比ReAct提升4.5%，训练后可达8.2%提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的网络代理在知识密集型任务上表现良好，但受到ReAct等范式中上下文窗口限制的阻碍。复杂查询涉及多个实体、交织关系和高不确定性，需要大量搜索周期，在达到完整解决方案之前迅速耗尽上下文预算

Method: 引入ReSum范式，通过定期上下文摘要将不断增长的交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态；提出ReSum-GRPO，整合GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播，使代理熟悉基于摘要的推理

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum平均比ReAct绝对提升4.5%，ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升达8.2%；WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要有效克服了LLM网络代理的上下文限制，实现了更好的性能和无限探索能力，在少量训练样本下就能超越现有开源网络代理

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究批判性评估了LLM激活解释方法，发现现有基准测试存在缺陷，解释结果往往反映了解释器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的真实激活模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活解释方法是否能真正揭示目标LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅仅反映了输入信息或解释器LLM的知识。

Method: 在先前工作使用的数据集上评估流行解释方法，并进行控制实验分析解释结果的信息来源。

Result: 解释方法在无需访问目标模型内部的情况下也能在基准测试中成功，且解释结果主要反映解释器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的激活模式。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试和实验控制来严格评估解释方法是否真正提供了对LLM操作的有意义洞察。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Conclusion: DISPLIB为火车调度问题研究提供了标准化平台，促进了算法的实证比较和社区发展

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了InPhyRe基准测试，用于评估大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面的能力，发现现有模型在违反物理规律的场景中推理能力较弱，存在语言偏见和视觉输入忽略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型仅编码训练时观察到的物理规律作为参数知识，无法处理违反这些规律的推理场景。人类具有从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要，但现有基准只评估参数知识而非归纳推理能力。

Method: 提出InPhyRe基准测试，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频来评估模型预测碰撞事件结果的能力，检查了13个大型多模态模型。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反普遍物理规律时，归纳物理推理能力较弱；(3)存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽略视觉输入，质疑模型对视觉输入的可信度。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面存在显著局限，需要改进以增强在违反物理规律场景中的推理能力和视觉输入的利用可信度。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路线规划方法存在局限性：直接使用LLM处理大量地图数据困难，图搜索方法理解自然语言偏好能力有限，且用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路线查找，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个不同复杂度路由提示上进行实验，结果显示该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能且有保证

Conclusion: LLMAP系统成功解决了自然语言驱动的路线规划中的关键挑战，在理解用户偏好和处理复杂约束方面表现出色

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Result: 该方法改善了资源受限模型的意图理解性能，甚至超越大型多模态大语言模型的基准性能

Conclusion: 分解方法能有效提升小型设备端模型的意图理解能力，为隐私保护和低延迟应用提供可行方案

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为\sys的熵增强框架，通过保持策略熵和多轮交互优化，解决了现有偏好优化方法在软件工程任务中输出多样性不足的问题，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在软件工程复杂任务中表现不佳，标准对齐方法（如DPO、KTO）虽然能对齐人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果，且现有方法主要针对单轮任务，无法处理多轮推理和工具集成需求。

Method: 提出\sys熵增强框架：1）增强偏好目标以显式保持策略熵；2）将学习推广到多轮交互优化而非单轮响应；3）采用混合最佳轨迹选择方案，结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法。

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，30B参数的\sys训练模型在open-weight模型中排名第一（\lite）和第四（\verified），性能超过参数量10倍以上的模型（如>350B）。

Conclusion: \sys框架有效解决了偏好优化中的多样性损失问题，通过熵增强和多轮交互优化，显著提升了LLM在复杂软件工程任务中的性能，为交互式编码代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask训练改善动态物体建模，采用Warm Start推理技术提升预测质量

Result: 在相同参数规模(400M)下比基线提升60.6%加权总分；最小PIWM(130M)比最大基线模型(400M)提升7.4%加权总分且推理速度快28%

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，实现了小参数规模下的高性能物理建模，为边缘设备部署高效世界模型提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

TL;DR: 论文提出Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC)方法，通过在剪枝过程中同时重构输入和思维链激活，显著提升推理语言模型的压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，但推理任务以解码为主，导致标准压缩技术在推理模型上性能损失更大，甚至可能使模型更慢

Method: 在剪枝过程中联合重构输入激活和模型在策略思维链轨迹的激活，该方法可无缝集成到现有剪枝工作流如SparseGPT中

Result: RAC方法显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，解决了推理模型压缩中的性能损失问题

Conclusion: 针对推理任务的特殊性质设计压缩方法很重要，RAC为推理语言模型的高效部署提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the

TL;DR: PowerGPT是一个AI驱动的系统，通过整合大语言模型和统计引擎，自动化临床试验设计中的检验选择和样本量计算，显著提高了完成率、准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究和试验设计中的样本量计算对统计专业知识要求高，复杂性强，给许多研究者造成了障碍，需要一种更易用、准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发了PowerGPT系统，将大语言模型与统计引擎集成，自动化进行检验选择和样本量估计。通过随机试验评估其有效性。

Result: 在随机试验中，PowerGPT显著提高了任务完成率（检验选择99.3% vs 88.9%，样本量计算99.3% vs 77.8%）和准确性（样本量估计94.1% vs 55.4%，p<0.001），同时减少了平均完成时间（4.0 vs 9.3分钟，p<0.001）。这些优势在不同统计检验中表现一致，对统计学家和非统计学家都有帮助。

Conclusion: PowerGPT代表了一种可扩展的AI驱动方法，能够提高临床研究中统计功效分析的可及性、效率和准确性，目前已在多个机构部署使用。

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Motivation: 研究认知科学和计算机科学如何共同分类和解释任务难度，探索智能机制如何通过利用物理约束和认知策略来降低问题复杂度。

Method: 通过分析Soma Cube拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度）来量化任务难度，逐步引入预处理（认知组块）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）等策略。

Result: 研究表明，通过分层策略可以显著降低搜索复杂度，有效利用物理制品能够通过利用物理约束来降低时间复杂性。

Conclusion: 智能可以被建模为一个算法库，能够同时利用心智和物质的能力，物质性原则为理解智能机制提供了新的框架。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过两阶段可解释工作流分析俄亥俄州环岛事故，发现黑暗、湿滑路面和高速条件下固定物体或角度碰撞事故更严重，而晴朗低速条件下事故较轻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环岛虽然减少了严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要可解释的分析方法来理解不同条件下的碰撞机制和严重性驱动因素。

Method: 使用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别共现因素并生成四种事故模式，然后基于树的严重性模型结合SHAP进行解释，量化模式内和跨模式的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 识别出四种事故模式：入口处(未能让行、间隙接受)、多车道循环内(不当操作)和减速期间(追尾)。黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速与固定物体或角度事件同时发生时严重性更高。

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释联系起来，支持场地筛选、对策选择和审计就绪报告，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释人工智能模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from

Motivation: 传统客服中心存在处理时间长、首次解决率低、客户满意度差的问题，现有AI辅助工具多为被动响应，缺乏深度上下文推理能力。

Method: 采用Agentic AI方法，集成实时转录、意图识别、情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索、动态客户画像和部分对话摘要等技术，实现主动式工作流和持续上下文构建。

Result: 在实际部署中，Minerva CQ作为AI副驾驶，在多個部署中实现了座席效率和客户体验的可衡量改进。

Conclusion: Agentic AI驱动的实时座席辅助系统能够有效解决传统客服中心的痛点，通过主动式、上下文感知的方式提升整体服务质量。

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个使用大语言模型生成专门化启发式集成，并通过自适应选择机制实现从实例特征到启发式配置的可泛化映射的框架，解决了SAT求解器配置泛化性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置不可得，现有方法缺乏泛化性且需要为新的问题类型重新优化，成本高昂

Method: 使用大语言模型在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专门化启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制形成最终映射

Result: 实验显示DaSAThco实现了优越性能，特别是在非自适应方法表现有限的领域外泛化方面表现出强大鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析方法难以捕捉复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了可靠性。大型语言模型虽具备强大文本理解能力，但需要更好的方法来整合历史经济情境。

Method: AD-FCoT提示框架，结合类比推理和思维链提示，引导LLM在新事件与已知结果的历史场景间建立类比，并生成结构化、逐步推理的思维链。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验表明，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性和市场回报相关性方面均优于强基线方法，生成的解释也与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT是首批在金融领域明确结合类比示例与思维链推理的方法之一，通过纯提示方式提供可解释的金融分析洞察，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Motivation: 解决Text2SQL生成中语法正确但语义误解用户意图的问题，并应对基准测试数据质量差对模型评估的干扰。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，专门设计智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言以验证逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后的Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，并强调了基准测试完整性的重要性，呼吁更严格的数据集管理。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Motivation: 预测牛群体重增长有助于大型畜牧场优化饲养策略、做出明智育种决策，并降低气候多变性和市场波动的风险。

Method: 使用随机森林(RF)模型，并与支持向量回归(SVR)和长短期记忆(LSTM)模型进行比较，利用756个样本数据和天气数据(降雨和温度)进行预测。

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上表现最佳，当包含天气和年龄因素时，R²为0.973，RMSE为0.040，MAE为0.033。

Conclusion: 研究表明RF模型是预测牛群体重增长的强大工具，年龄和气候因素对预测准确性有显著影响，并开发了自动化预处理工具供研究使用。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种新颖的心电图编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，使任何LLM都能直接解释，解决了现有方法在可迁移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在ECG分析中存在三个主要问题：模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer架构难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、黑盒特性限制临床应用。

Method: ECG-aBcDe通过构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，无需修改LLM架构即可直接微调预训练模型，实现双向可转换性并提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标显著提升，数据集内评估提升2.8倍(42.58分)，跨数据集评估提升3.9倍(30.76分)。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，证明了该方法的可行性，显著提升了性能指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖专家经验且缺乏系统性自动化，现有LLM优化方法主要作为被动约束验证器而非主动策略设计者，无法处理复杂约束交互

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码；建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，结合进化算法进行局部优化和蒙特卡洛树搜索进行全局策略探索

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试上的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线方法的性能

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法革新了NCOP求解，实现了约束优化的端到端自动化，在碎片化解空间中取得了强化与多样化的最优平衡

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

*Lachlan McGinness,Peter Baumgartner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对前沿大语言模型在18个月内的推理能力进行纵向研究，发现通过思维链提示和思维模型的引入，模型性能显著提升。提出了一种神经符号架构，使用较小参数量的LLM将问题转化为标准化形式，再用SMT求解器Z3进行求解，大幅降低计算成本的同时保持近乎完美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法，以降低计算成本同时保持高性能。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型（2023年12月、2024年9月、2025年6月），评估其准确性和对推理策略的忠实度。提出神经符号架构：用小参数LLM将问题标准化，然后用Z3 SMT求解器进行求解。

Result: 从2023到2024年性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024到2025年思维模型的引入带来显著改进。神经符号方法将计算成本显著降低（FLOPs减少），同时保持近乎完美的性能。推理FLOPs的常见近似计算在所有实验中准确度在10%以内。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续改进，神经符号架构提供了一种计算效率更高的替代方案，能够在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一种无需训练的图推理方法，利用检索增强生成和LLM的代码生成能力，通过生成可执行代码查询图数据库来处理各种图推理任务，在大多数任务上达到100%准确率且具有良好的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在开发一种无需训练、能够处理广泛图推理任务的通用框架。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算和最大流）达到100%准确率，子图匹配性能也很高，可扩展到10,000个节点的大型图。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种有效且可扩展的训练无关图推理解决方案，通过结合RAG和LLM代码生成能力，克服了传统方法的限制，在多种图任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

TL;DR: 提出分层记忆架构H²R，通过分离高层规划记忆和低层执行记忆，实现细粒度知识迁移，提升LLM智能体在多任务场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将先验经验和知识视为整体单元，导致知识迁移效率低下且粒度粗糙，需要更细粒度的知识迁移机制。

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，分离高层规划记忆和低层执行记忆；引入Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H²R)机制，从过往交互中提炼可重用的分层知识；测试时分别检索高低层记忆。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，H²R能够提高泛化能力和决策性能，优于Expel等先前基线方法。

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制能够有效实现细粒度知识迁移，显著提升LLM智能体在多任务场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker是一个潜在思维增强训练框架，通过增加潜在思维分布的方差和引入基于分布的定向优化范式，提升大语言模型的复杂推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Coconut和SoftCoT在连续潜在空间推理中有效，但高质量潜在思维的生成和利用仍是核心瓶颈。基于SoftCoT++理论，更大的潜在思维分布方差能更好逼近真实分布。

Method: 1) 基于可学习先验构建潜在思维生成架构，增加生成向量的方差分布；2) 引入基于分布的定向优化范式，结合SFT损失、语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理聚焦损失（对比学习）进行多目标协同训练。

Result: 实验表明LTA-Thinker在各种基线中达到最先进性能，展现出更高的性能上限和更好的扩展效果。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强潜在思维分布的方差和优化分布特性，有效提升了大语言模型的复杂推理能力，为动态优化推理过程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven

TL;DR: HLSMAC是一个基于《三十六计》设计的新型多智能体强化学习基准测试，包含12个星际争霸II场景，专注于评估高级战略决策能力，超越了传统微操测试的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习基准（如SMAC）主要关注微观操作，缺乏对高级战略智能的全面评估，需要新的测试环境来推动战略决策能力的发展。

Method: 基于《三十六计》中的经典策略设计了12个星际争霸II场景，每个场景对应一个具体策略，挑战智能体的战术机动、时机协调和欺骗等战略元素。提出了超越传统胜率的多维度评估指标，包括能力利用率和推进效率等。

Result: 将最先进的多智能体强化学习算法和基于大语言模型的智能体集成到HLSMAC中进行全面实验，结果表明该基准能够有效评估和推进多智能体战略决策能力。

Conclusion: HLSMAC作为一个强大的测试平台，为评估和提升多智能体高级战略决策能力开辟了新途径，填补了现有基准在战略层面评估的空白。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

TL;DR: FSRL是一种透明的对齐框架，通过训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器的可解释特征，实现与RLHF相当的效果但具有更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF方法会导致参数发生弥散、不透明的变化，难以理解模型内化了什么内容，需要更透明的对齐方法。

Method: 使用特征引导强化学习(FSRL)，训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器(SAE)提取的可解释特征，从而控制模型行为。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略系统性地促进风格特征而非显式对齐概念。

Conclusion: FSRL提供了可解释的模型控制工具和对齐机制诊断手段，发现偏好优化过程将风格呈现作为质量的代理进行奖励。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供的黑盒大模型，权重不可用，因此需要解决黑盒模型融合的挑战

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含稀疏性去噪（识别过滤无关信息）和符号感知缩放（动态计算最优组合权重）两个关键组件

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进性能，显著优于现有强基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型融合问题，为仅通过API访问的模型集成提供了可行方案

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Motivation: 传统持续学习模型面临隐私泄露风险，统一的差分隐私预算会导致模型性能显著下降，阻碍在隐私敏感领域的应用

Method: 1) 引入token级动态差分隐私策略，根据语义敏感度自适应分配隐私预算；2) 集成隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息同时保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 大量实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间实现了优越的平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护，优于基线模型

Conclusion: PeCL框架通过动态隐私预算分配和智能记忆管理，有效解决了持续学习中的隐私-效用权衡问题，为隐私敏感领域的持续学习应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在自主执行复杂任务时缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要外部工具支持来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 开发Planning Copilot聊天机器人，集成多种规划工具，通过Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准连接LLMs与外部工具，支持语法检查、规划器选择、计划生成验证和执行模拟等任务。

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLM时表现远超无工具支持的相同LLM，在有限定性比较中甚至显著优于最新的商业LLM GPT-5。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs能够有效执行规划任务的有效途径，MCP协议为LLM与外部工具集成提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则（成功需满足少量必要条件，失败形式多样）及其变体在不同文本媒介中的适用性，探索不同领域成功与失败的结构模式差异

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影四种媒介

Result: 不同媒介呈现不同结构模式：小说顺序遵循反向AKP；维基百科结合AKP与有序模式；学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置保持嘈杂；电影类型间存在分化

Conclusion: 成功依赖于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态，结构原则因媒介而异

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学推理任务上表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，因此需要建立一个专门的基准来评估LLMs在这类问题上的性能。

Method: 创建了包含369个大学录取问题实例的基准，评估多个开源LLMs在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度的表现，测试了包括Chain-of-Thought、In-Context Learning和基于角色的提示等多种提示策略。

Result: LLMs能够满足某些约束但难以一致满足所有评估标准；推理模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型；不同提示策略效果差异明显，没有一种策略始终最优；迭代提示性能非单调，可能早期达到峰值后显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角，揭示了LLMs在匹配问题中的局限性以及不同推理方法的相对优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法G-CSEA，用于高效识别伪布尔约束调度模型中的不可行子集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量求解器调用，而双射线分析在伪布尔模型失效，需要更高效的冲突检测方法

Method: 受SAT求解器中冲突驱动子句学习启发，构建蕴含图进行约束传播，检测冲突时追踪所有决策分支的贡献约束，可选使用QuickXplain最小化为IIS

Result: G-CSEA算法能够有效提取冲突集，减少求解器调用次数，提高不可行性诊断效率

Conclusion: 图基冲突集提取方法为伪布尔约束调度模型的不可行性分析提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型（GPT-4o和MedGemma）在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中的表现，发现MedGemma在基线评估中表现更优，而GPT-4o在结合MedGemma描述性输出时能达到高准确率，表明MLLMs可改善DR筛查流程并作为临床AI辅助研究的可扩展模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。研究旨在探索最有效的输出格式来增强临床医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上测试GPT-4o和MedGemma两个模型，包括：(1)基线评估，(2)使用合成预测模拟AI辅助，(3)实际AI协作（GPT-4o整合MedGemma输出）。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o（更高的敏感性和AUROC），GPT-4o具有近乎完美的特异性但敏感性低。在协作中，GPT-4o结合MedGemma描述性输出时即使没有直接图像访问也能达到高准确率（AUROC达0.96）。

Conclusion: MLLMs可以改善DR筛查流程，并作为研究临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开放式轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，描述性输出可增强可解释性和临床信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 提出COLMA认知分层记忆架构，通过场景驱动方法解决AI记忆系统的适应性、多模态整合和持续学习问题，为AGI发展提供结构化基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向AGI发展，现有记忆系统存在适应性有限、多模态整合不足、无法支持持续学习等问题，需要更鲁棒和类人的记忆系统

Method: 采用场景驱动方法，从代表性认知场景中提取关键功能需求，形成统一设计原则，提出COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)框架

Result: COLMA将认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制整合为统一设计，为开发具有终身学习和类人推理能力的AI系统提供结构化基础

Conclusion: COLMA架构有助于AGI的务实发展，为解决当前AI记忆系统的局限性提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够从少量数据中分离出特定概念的表示，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，同时揭示了这种技术可能带来的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生过于广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预，并更细致地理解LLM的行为机制。

Method: 提出了RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式从少量示例中提取特定概念的表征向量，能够精确定位到100-200个神经元，实现对模型拒绝行为的选择性抑制。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上验证，RepIt能够选择性抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他领域的安全性评分；仅需12个示例和单个A6000 GPU即可提取稳健的目标表示。

Conclusion: RepIt展示了针对性干预可以抵消模型的过度泛化，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也凸显了这种高效操纵技术可能带来的安全隐忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 虽然以语言智能体为例，但形状认知的原则可以更广泛地应用于知识驱动和混合人工智能，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.
