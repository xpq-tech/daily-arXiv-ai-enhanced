### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreetMath基准测试评估LLM在现实世界近似推理场景中的表现，发现LLM倾向于计算精确值而非近似值，且近似和精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，而对其在非正式、快速近似推理能力的研究较少，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准测试，评估多种LLM架构的近似能力，并应用机制可解释性技术分析其内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似的任务中仍试图计算精确值或调用外部工具，近似和精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件，且LLM未表现出人类在街头数学中的认知吝啬性。

Conclusion: LLM在近似推理方面与人类认知模式存在差异，需要进一步研究如何改进模型在现实世界近似场景中的表现。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，能够对实体评论进行强度分级（非常弱、弱、中等、强、非常强），并结合用户查询对实体进行排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法没有考虑情感强度，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同级别的意见表达。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度类别，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系，通过考虑与特定方面相关的意见词来计算实体得分。

Result: 该方法能够对实体评论进行更细粒度的情感强度分类，并基于此对实体进行排序。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地分析用户对实体各方面意见的强度，为基于情感分析的实体排序提供了更精细的解决方案。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LASTIST数据集，包含563,299个带标签的韩语句子，用于目标无关立场检测和时间演化立场检测，填补了韩语立场检测研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标相关任务和英语数据集，韩语等低资源语言缺乏相应资源，特别是在新兴的立场检测领域。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建大规模目标无关立场检测数据集，并训练最先进的深度学习模型进行验证。

Result: 成功构建了包含56.3万句韩语标注数据的LASTIST数据集，支持多种立场检测任务，包括目标无关立场检测和时间演化分析。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，推动了低资源语言立场检测的发展，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA方法，一种零延迟的融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs部署中，任务特定的适配器虽然参数很少（通常小于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的巨大计算开销（可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 开发了零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLMs上，zFLoRA在常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话等18个任务上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调（FFT）。在NPU和GPU平台上的延迟测量显示zFLoRA引入零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种高效的适配器方法，能在保持性能的同时显著降低推理延迟，适用于多下游应用的LLM部署场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种改进电路发现的方法：使用自举法识别一致归因边、引入基于比率的策略选择强正分数边、用整数线性规划替代贪心选择，在MIB基准上获得了更忠实和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机制可解释性中电路发现的主要挑战，即确定模型的哪些部分执行特定任务，基于MIB基准进行改进。

Method: 1. 使用自举法识别具有一致归因分数的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先考虑强正分数边，平衡性能和忠实性；3. 用整数线性规划替代标准贪心选择方法。

Result: 在多个MIB任务和模型上，该方法产生了更忠实的电路，并优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三种改进方法有效提升了电路发现的忠实性和性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用LLM作为零样本偏好预言机，通过自然语言指导从多目标选项中选择最佳方案，包含参数化（LISTEN-U）和非参数化（LISTEN-T）两种算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中选择最佳方案时的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂隐含偏好的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为偏好预言机，提出两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U通过LLM精炼参数化效用函数，LISTEN-T采用锦标赛式小批量选择方法。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等任务上的评估显示，LISTEN-U在偏好参数对齐时表现优异，LISTEN-T则提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作探索了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter框架通过对比长上下文与短上下文设置下的模型预测，识别具有长距离依赖关系的训练数据，用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分跨度仅需局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心选择数据。

Method: 引入LongFilter框架，通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测结果，衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别需要长距离依赖的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter为长上下文预训练提供了有效的数据筛选方法，能够识别真正需要长距离依赖的训练样本，提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答中实现比传统方法更高的准确性和效率，F1分数达0.90，同时减少78%的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中临床文档作为base64编码附件存储导致的语义问答困难，传统向量数据库方法常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发临床实体增强检索(CLEAR)方法，使用实体感知检索，并与零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成进行对比验证。

Result: CLEAR在12个临床笔记测试中达到58.3%胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，token使用量减少78%，在超过65,000个token的长文档中胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索显著提升临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架为临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

### [11] [Evaluating the Impact of LLM-Assisted Annotation in a Perspectivized Setting: the Case of FrameNet Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25904)
*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估LLM在FrameNet语义标注中的表现，比较人工、自动和半自动三种设置，发现半自动方法在框架多样性和标注覆盖度上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中应用广泛，但缺乏对其在标注数据集创建中性能和影响的全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 采用三种实验设置比较：人工标注、自动标注（使用LLM语义角色标注器）和半自动标注，评估标注时间、覆盖度和多样性。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置增加了框架多样性且保持相似标注覆盖度，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能够提高效率同时保持质量，而纯自动方法在质量方面仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [12] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个代理式管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括越狱模块来克服对齐导致的拒绝，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著提升了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要找到可靠的方法来了解模型实际看到的内容，最有力的证据是模型自由重现目标内容。

Method: 采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落并识别差异，然后将差异转化为最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升，GPT-4.1的版权文本提取ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提升了提取性能，为理解模型训练数据提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了多语言预训练的传统观点，发现在1.1B和3B参数规模的LLMs中，增加训练语言数量(25-400种)不会显著降低性能，英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处，且适当平衡的多语言数据能提升模型能力而不损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是探讨语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间的权衡关系（即多语言诅咒假设）。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLMs，使用不同的多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400种不等，分析英语作为枢纽语言的作用以及不同语言家族的影响。

Result: 发现英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任一组的语言内性能（前提是语言在预训练语料中包含足够token）；英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处；未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力，即使在低资源设置下也不会损害性能，挑战了关于多语言训练的传统假设。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译在低资源语言中生成合成数据时，由于文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，LLMs编码的文化知识会放大这种漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，因为文化差异可能导致翻译过程中的标签漂移或改变。

Method: 通过一系列实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括现代LLMs）在文化敏感和中性领域的表现，分析文化相似性对标签保存的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译中会引起标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2) LLMs编码的文化知识会放大标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言的文化相似性是标签保存的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，通过将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提升LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成会产生未经验证且算术上不可靠的解。现有的提示策略如思维链仍在这种不可靠的媒介中操作，缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，不仅更token高效，还将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎，SymCode代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能的矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和缓存策略优化，在LLM推理任务中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是在矩阵乘法这一关键计算内核上。

Method: 采用针对Trainium定制化的技术，包括内核融合和新型缓存策略，以减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，并避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，与AWS现有实现相比，矩阵乘法内核平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 通过针对Trainium架构的专门优化，成功实现了在LLM推理任务中矩阵乘法内核和整体性能的显著提升。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache通过重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2倍和1.6倍的端到端加速，注意力计算速度提升2-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载（如分类、问答、推荐等）仅使用LLM推理的prefill阶段，其中自注意力计算因二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。观察到语义不同的句子在不同层和头上会产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理时识别并重用预缓存的相似注意力图，减少自注意力计算开销。

Result: 实验结果显示，AttnCache在CPU上平均实现1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效加速LLM prefill阶段推理，显著提升性能且保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家动作相似性的逐步奖励，解决小模型在多步推理任务中的学习困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳，小规模开源模型在使用可验证奖励的强化学习时难以采样到正确解，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供逐步奖励。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习之前SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题，先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强性能，在智能软件工程任务上也有效泛化。

Conclusion: SRL是一个强大且通用的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的学习瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一种强化学习方法，通过鼓励工具使用LLM探索多种正确答案的轨迹来解决静态训练数据限制问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法在动态环境中探索多种解决方案，导致性能受限

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为查询生成多个轨迹形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配步骤奖励；3)使用分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM

Result: 在17个工具的实验环境中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数方面相比其他训练方法有显著提升

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种工具调用轨迹，有效提升了LLM在动态工具调用环境中的性能

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估跨语言对齐中知识迁移与文化擦除权衡的框架，发现现有方法在改善事实迁移的同时会损害文化本地化，并基于模型层间差异提出了手术式引导方法来平衡这两个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐追求多语言表示的统一，但可能导致"文化擦除"，即模型无法根据查询语言提供文化特定的响应。本文旨在系统分析这一权衡问题。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架，重新评估现有CLA方法；分析模型内部表示；提出手术式引导方法，在不同模型层应用针对性激活引导来分离事实迁移和文化特定知识。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致改善了事实迁移，但直接以文化本地化为代价；模型不同层分别最优地控制通用事实迁移和文化特定知识。

Conclusion: 手术式引导方法通过在模型不同层应用针对性激活引导，能够更好地平衡知识迁移和文化本地化这两个竞争维度，克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的工具来识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，发现7.8%的患者存在偶发甲状腺发现，这些发现与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着影像学检查的普及，偶发甲状腺发现的检出率不断增加，但其流行率、特征和临床后果尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自然语言处理管道，回顾性分析2017-2023年间115,683名无甲状腺病史患者的放射学报告，识别偶发甲状腺发现并提取结节特征。

Result: 7.8%的患者存在偶发甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。这些患者进行甲状腺超声、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。大多数癌症为乳头状癌，且发现时体积更大。

Conclusion: 偶发甲状腺发现很常见，且与导致小、低风险癌症检测的级联效应密切相关，强调了其在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用，需要标准化报告和更有选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: 提出了QCoder Benchmark评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在量子编程任务上的表现，结合量子模拟器反馈和真实人类代码对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）表现未被充分探索，需要专门的评估框架来测试模型生成可执行量子代码的能力。

Method: 开发QCoder Benchmark，包含两个关键特性：1）支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间等域特定指标；2）整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交，进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4o等先进模型准确率仅约18.97%，而基于推理的o3模型达到78%准确率，超过了人类代码平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 量子编程对LLM具有挑战性，推理模型表现优于标准模型；QCoder Benchmark为量子代码生成研究提供了有价值的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种"一问题多解法"（1PNS）训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异度（RPD）指标来选择和训练多样化的推理路径，从而提升模型输出的多样性，增强测试时扩展的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的"一问题一解法"（1P1S）训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展的效果，需要一种能够增加推理路径多样性的训练方法。

Method: 提出了推理路径差异度（RPD）指标来衡量多步思维链之间的语义差异，基于RPD为每个问题选择最大多样性的解法集，并对Qwen3-4B-Base模型进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，RPD选择的训练集产生了更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能够有效增强模型输出多样性，进一步提升测试时扩展的效果。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，本研究旨在探索这两者之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器为每个实例标注22种PDTB 3.0二级话语关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，创建5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中至关重要，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和表达怀疑时。

Conclusion: 这项研究为检测网络宣传和错误信息提供了重要见解，并增进了我们对有效沟通的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了表达能力。需要一种能够模拟多头注意力机制的更高效架构。

Method: 使用混合专家(MoE)实现，不仅在通道混合MLP块中，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"，构建MossNet架构。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet在相似模型大小和数据预算下优于transformer和SSM架构。更大规模的变体在万亿token训练中证实了其可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的一个有前景的新方向，在运行时速度和资源使用方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Motivation: 提高语言模型在指令遵循任务中的统计效率，减少弃权情况，使生成内容更可靠地位于高概率区域。

Method: 将预训练的仅解码器Transformer语言模型通过监督微调转换为SDM语言模型，使用最终层SDM激活层估计监督下一个令牌损失的基变换，结合对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负例。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM语言模型减少了弃权情况，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提高指令遵循任务的性能，通过特定的激活层设计和训练方法实现了更好的校准和统计效率。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽略了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对于实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转化为多种指令风格，引入跨响应相似性(CRS)方法来测量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上的十个LLM实验表明，指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7%。确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一个原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过每个token的时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。这可以是固定策略或由任务信号驱动的自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度几乎减半，且仅使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别出少量可解释特征来解释偏好预测信号，揭示人类偏好的多样性，并可用于数据筛选和个性化偏好建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设特征，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，既能表征数据集能够测量的偏好，也能表征标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集上，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释特征，这些特征解释了黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。特征揭示了人类偏好的广泛多样性，以及数据集上下文的作用。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，以更好地理解和利用偏好数据，可用于数据筛选和个性化偏好建模。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来显著提升全局检索增强生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（在少量文档中检索相关片段），但许多实际应用需要全局RAG能力（跨整个文档集合聚合信息以获取语料级洞察）。

Method: 提出了GlobalRAG框架，包含：1）通过块级检索保持结构连贯性；2）LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档；3）聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 现有RAG方法在全局任务上表现不佳，GlobalRAG框架通过多工具协作有效解决了全局RAG挑战，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提高其在理解隐含含义任务上的表现，相比基准方法提升高达9.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型需要具备准确理解隐含含义的能力，这在人类交流和语言使用中至关重要。

Method: 提出将语用学理论（如格莱斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示，引导语言模型进行逐步推理以得出最终解释。

Result: 相比不提供语用学理论的基准方法（0-shot Chain-of-Thought），该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上的得分提高高达9.6%。在更大模型中，仅提及语用学理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提供语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能显著提升语言模型理解隐含含义的能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现预训练语言模型在区分外来词和本族语词汇方面表现不佳，即使提供明确指令和上下文信息，模型仍难以准确识别外来词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类说话者区分外来词和本族语词汇的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续向少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了多个预训练语言模型在10种语言上的表现，测试模型在明确指令和上下文信息下区分外来词和本族语词汇的能力。

Result: 模型在区分外来词和本族语词汇方面表现很差，证实了现代NLP系统对外来词而非本族语等价词存在偏见。

Conclusion: 这项研究对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及支持在主导语言词汇压力下的语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了知识蒸馏在跨语言视觉语言模型压缩中的行为，发现不同蒸馏方法对多语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均衡，模型压缩会加剧这一问题。知识蒸馏在跨语言场景中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用五种蒸馏方法在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上进行实证研究，评估跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性。

Result: 某些配置在模型尺寸减半的情况下仍能保持或改善多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了设计敏感的权衡。

Conclusion: 仅靠聚合准确度无法完全揭示知识蒸馏在跨语言模型压缩中的复杂行为，需要更细致的评估方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，利用神经元激活的稀疏性和跨样本一致性来选择最佳候选答案，无需外部信号或可比较的文本输出，实现高效的集成解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活更少神经元且跨样本一致性更强。

Method: 基于神经元激活分析，提出NAD方法：1）利用激活稀疏性（正确回答激活更少神经元）2）利用跨样本神经元一致性（正确回答激活模式更一致），实现无监督的最佳候选选择。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期停止可减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，支持早期正确预测和激进早期停止。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLMs在数字输入嵌入表示准确性与输出错误之间的冲突，探索语言模型如何处理数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 分析不同语言模型的数字表示，创建通用探针来追踪信息流动，包括输出错误的来源到特定层。

Result: 发现尽管存在表面错误，但不同LLMs学习到了可互换的、系统性的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文中具有高度准确性和通用性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs处理数字的方式提供了基本理解，并指出了更准确探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文对OpenAI的ChatGPT Atlas在网页交互能力进行了早期评估，使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景，发现Atlas在逻辑推理任务中表现优异，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的性能尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在评估Atlas在网页交互方面的能力。

Method: 使用浏览器游戏（包括Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world）作为测试场景，以游戏性能得分作为量化指标来评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成谜题的速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: 虽然Atlas展示了强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显限制。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的三大挑战：隐私问题、有限计算资源和需要教学有效响应，开发能在本地运行的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具和自我反思推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的性能，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型高效模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在需要深入原理理解的专业领域（如经济学、心理学）表现不佳，需要解决这一领域差距。

Method: ACER首先为特定学科生成目录结构，然后基于Bloom分类法创建难度递增的问答对，形成系统性课程。使用交错课程安排进行持续预训练，在内容和认知维度上对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在专业MMLU子集上显著提升性能，微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点。非目标领域性能也提升0.7点，知识密集型基准测试ARC和GPQA提升超过2点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来缩小大语言模型在关键领域的能力差距，同时防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些歪曲科学发现的论点难以识别，需要有效方法来增强LLM的谬误识别能力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对LLM进行轻量级微调，利用MISSCI数据集和框架进行实验。

Conclusion: 通过合成谬误数据增强有限标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使计算资源有限。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型组，反映其潜在专长。识别的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专长手动构建的团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新基础，证明了基于交互的方法在识别模型协同性方面的有效性。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Result: 在11个主流LLMs上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度表现最好的QWQ模型仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用方面仍有显著改进空间，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLMs教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可在保持性能的同时实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然语言能力出色，但部署时面临巨大的带宽和计算需求。单独使用剪枝或低秩逼近效果有限，两者的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，保留模型核心结构的同时去除非必要权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上，SSLC无需额外训练就超越了单独方法，达到SOTA结果。压缩Qwen2.5 50%无性能损失，速度提升至少1.63倍。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，证明了稀疏和低秩方法的协同优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出BNLF框架，通过贝叶斯网络融合三个LLM的预测结果，在情感分析任务中实现约6%的准确率提升，增强模型鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定LLM存在的透明度低、微调成本高、提示工程复杂、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络进行后期融合，将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人类标注金融语料库上评估，相比基线LLM获得约6%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架通过概率融合机制实现了可解释的情感分类，对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用多个LLM代理的集成方法，相比单一LLM，能更可靠地评估基于像素的AI分诊工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否能比单一LLM提供更可靠的AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 分析了29,766例非增强CT头部检查，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统，通过多轮提示评估颅内出血(ICH)存在情况。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳(AUC=0.78)。LLM集成方法在MCC指标上优于单一GPT-4o，且不同集成配置间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致可靠的方法，用于临床AI分诊工具的回顾性评估。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: CORE-KG框架通过消融实验验证了其两个关键组件（指代消解模块和结构化提示）在构建法律文本知识图谱中的重要性，分别减少了节点重复和噪声节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律案例文档中由于非结构化、词汇密集和指代模糊导致的自动化知识图谱构建困难，特别是LLM方法产生的噪声和碎片化问题。

Method: 使用CORE-KG框架，集成了类型感知的指代消解模块和领域指导的结构化提示，通过消融实验量化两个组件的贡献。

Result: 移除指代消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: CORE-KG的两个组件对构建高质量法律文本知识图谱都至关重要，为设计稳健的LLM提取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: DIVRIT是一个新颖的希伯来语变音符号恢复系统，将任务构建为零样本分类问题，使用视觉语言模型处理未变音文本图像，在候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，未变音文本存在高度歧义性，需要先进方法提升性能。

Method: 将任务构建为单词级零样本分类问题，使用希伯来语视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中基于上下文选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中）达到高准确率，通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升系统泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在希伯来语自动变音符号恢复中具有显著潜力，能够在不依赖复杂显式语言分析的情况下有效执行变音任务。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现这些解码器不是编码特定关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这解释了它们的高压缩性和有限的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统性地研究多关系解码器的组织结构，解释其高压缩性的原因。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主体。

Result: 发现线性映射不编码不同关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这些属性中心结构解释了操作符的可压缩性。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而不是关系特定的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: 提出了InfoFlow框架来解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三个方法，显著提升了搜索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习面临奖励密度低的问题，智能体需要付出大量探索成本才能获得稀少甚至为零的最终奖励，这限制了RLVR的应用效果。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长距离任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用精炼智能体压缩搜索历史，减轻探索认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性提升奖励密度，有效解决了深度搜索中的探索效率问题，为强化学习在复杂任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型由于自回归设计和庞大尺寸面临显著推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进，但忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小等因素）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六个不同任务和六种不同LLM上的综合实验显示，该方法相比传统解码方法速度提升高达5.2倍，通常优于现有最先进技术5%到20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量动态优化树结构，有效解决了LLM推理延迟问题，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档的智能代理框架，特别针对幻灯片文档。它通过分层专业化代理实现全局、页面和元素级别的推理，显著提升了文档理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型虽然提供了文档理解的机会，但仍需改进以应对这类挑战。

Method: SlideAgent采用专业化代理框架，将推理分解为三个层次：全局、页面和元素级别。它构建结构化的、与查询无关的表示，捕捉整体主题和详细的视觉或文本线索。在推理过程中，选择性激活专业化代理进行多级推理，并将输出整合为连贯的、上下文感知的答案。

Result: 大量实验表明，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升了7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升了9.8%，在文档理解任务上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAgent通过分层专业化代理框架，有效解决了多页面视觉文档理解的挑战，在细粒度推理方面表现出色，为复杂文档理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度对编码器-解码器模型的严谨比较，可能忽略了其潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用解码器模型的现代技术，在150M到8B参数规模上进行全面比较，使用RedPajama V1预训练和FLAN指令微调。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的缩放特性和强大性能，在指令微调后在下游任务上达到相当甚至更好的结果，同时具有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构的潜力可能被低估，值得重新审视以开发更强大高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升最高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应方面具有有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。核心是Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)，通过精细门控机制提升有限状态RNN内存利用效率，并采用优化的分块算法实现硬件高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前线性注意力机制在性能上仍落后于全注意力，特别是在复杂任务中。研究旨在开发一种既能保持线性复杂度，又能在各种场景下超越全注意力性能的架构。

Method: 提出Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)模块，扩展Gated DeltaNet并引入更精细的门控机制；采用专门优化的Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)转移矩阵变体，开发高效的分块算法；构建3B激活参数、48B总参数的层间混合架构，结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)。

Result: 在相同训练方案下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少高达75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍，在长输入输出任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在处理长序列任务时。开源了KDA内核、vLLM实现及预训练模型，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一个新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正的端到端生成，让模型学习控制自身的解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的端到端标签是误导性的，实际上依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，这过程繁琐且需要专业知识。

Method: 在标准transformer基础上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度和top-p值，同时预测下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"测试集黑客"获得的oracle调优基线相当的性能。模型还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开启了可引导和交互式LLM解码的新范式，使模型能够根据自然语言指令动态调整解码策略。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了LLM在训练过程中价值对齐的动态过程，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐价值观，不同偏好优化算法会导致不同的价值对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要研究它们如何学习与人类价值观对齐。先前工作主要关注已训练模型的对齐评估，而忽略了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，通过合成偏好数据集进行受控实验，测量价值漂移的幅度和时间。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常确立模型的核心价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同的偏好数据，也会产生不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了价值观在训练过程中的学习机制，为数据筛选、模型选择以及偏好优化算法的选择提供了实用指导，以改进模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度的人类编写问题，用于评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级LLMs的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和问题，需要更严格的挑战来推动数学推理能力的发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、符合IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但发现随着测试时计算量增加存在有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench突显了当前LLMs在数学推理方面的显著改进空间，可作为推动语言模型推理能力发展的研究工具。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify任务要求编码LLM从完整代码库中提取特定功能的核心代码，生成一个最小化的独立文件来复现相同功能，测试模型对代码库结构和执行流的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估任务来测试其能力。

Method: 提出Gistify任务：给编码LLM完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成最小化的独立文件来复现相同功能输出。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在Gistify任务上表现不佳，特别是在执行轨迹较长的任务中难以可靠解决。

Conclusion: Gistify任务能有效评估编码LLM对代码库结构理解、执行流建模和大型代码补丁生成的能力，现有模型在这方面仍有明显不足。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将SHAP可解释AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献度，使引擎评估更加透明和可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数，无法揭示单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体因素。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，采用SHAP技术系统地移除棋子，计算每个棋子的加性贡献，提供局部忠实且人类可解释的分析。

Result: 开发了一种能够将引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到传统象棋教学中移除棋子分析思路的启发。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性，推动了可解释象棋AI的研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 研究比较了高约束和低约束提示对游戏NPC对话体验的影响，发现约束程度对玩家体验无显著差异，但角色类型影响约束效果。提出了符号化支架游戏框架，用模糊数值边界平衡连贯性和即兴发挥。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索约束提示是否能真正改善LLM驱动的游戏NPC对话体验，解决当前对约束提示效果认识不足的问题。

Method: 通过语音侦探游戏The Interview进行用户研究(N=10)，比较高低约束提示；然后重新设计为混合JSON+RAG支架，用LLM法官进行合成评估。

Result: 发现支架效果具有角色依赖性：面试官NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑人NPC失去即兴可信度；约束程度对玩家体验无可靠差异。

Conclusion: 推翻"更严格约束必然增强游戏体验"的假设，提出符号化支架游戏框架，用模糊符号边界在需要稳定性的地方保持连贯性，在需要惊喜的地方保留即兴发挥。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

TL;DR: 提出了一个人机协作框架，通过拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，用于改进LLM评估器的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，人类判断涉及超越标注标签的微妙推理，而思维轨迹难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中重构思维轨迹，并应用于微调开源LLM评估器和合成更清晰的专有LLM评估器标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，精炼的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，将仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了系统在不确定环境中必须通过预测压缩最小化认知熵的机制，压缩效率原则(CEP)则说明高效压缩如何通过异常累积动态选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体解释为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式。作者旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次框架：信息论必要性(ITI)从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求，压缩效率原则(CEP)从机制角度说明高效压缩如何选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关，异常累积率可区分因果模型和相关性模型，分层系统在不同抽象层表现出递增效率，生物系统的代谢成本与表征复杂性相关。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的智能收敛提供了统一解释，涵盖了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Motivation: LLM评委难以校准，存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性问题，这阻碍了RLHF中可靠奖励模型的构建和路由系统的开发。

Method: 提出了基于角色的偏好建模框架，通过聚合多个评分标准条件下的评委输出，使用GAM和MLP两种聚合器实现。

Result: 评估了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过案例研究验证了其对人类和LLM评委偏见的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够大规模合成基于角色的偏好标签，为RLHF和模型路由系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的小型语言模型Humans-Junior在FACTS基准测试中与GPT-4o表现相当（在±5个百分点等效范围内），同时云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持与大型模型相当性能的同时大幅降低推理成本，实现更广泛的实际部署。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导模型遵循协议而非记忆领域知识，两者协同作用显著提升性能并降低方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5pp范围内等效。推理成本降低约19倍。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的推理支架和行为微调，小型模型可以达到与大型前沿模型相当的准确性，同时实现显著的成本优势，为高效AI部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,

example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

### [69] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调SQL生成、执行和可视化，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等挑战。

Method: 扩展了基础的llama-3-sqlcoder-8b模型，使用基于Mistral的ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询测试中，代理系统准确率达到91.4%，显著优于基线模型的28.6%，并能提供地图、图表和自然语言摘要。

Conclusion: 代理编排比单纯强化SQL生成器更有前景，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有力基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，能够在车辆陷入困境时通过自主推理或乘客指导来解决问题，无需修改原有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案成本高、效率低且限制了非驾驶员的使用。

Method: 设计了一个插件式LLM驱动框架，利用标准传感器数据流检测困境状态、解析环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高层恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客指导后表现进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver为自动驾驶车辆提供了一种有效且可扩展的困境恢复解决方案，提高了系统的可靠性和可访问性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速增强，确保AI对消费者、选民和决策者负责变得至关重要。当前许多AI系统缺乏问责性，无法被质疑、讨论或制裁。

Method: 将一般问责性定义应用于AI，阐释AI问责性的含义，并探索提高AI问责性的方法。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，指出了当前AI问责性不足的问题，提出了改善问责性的途径。

Conclusion: 需要建立机制确保所有AI对其影响对象具有问责性，包括信息提供、讨论和制裁能力。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的不足，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了跨6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面表现不佳。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更具潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 基于WiNEval-3.0的实证数据，构建LLM推理生产前沿，分析边际成本、规模经济和成本效益最优区域。

Result: 揭示了三个原则：边际成本递减、规模收益递减以及存在最优成本效益区域，为AI推理资源的市场定价和优化提供了实证基础。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法，先在数学领域进行RL训练培养推理能力，然后在多领域联合RL中迁移和巩固这些能力，无需专门奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习能激发大语言模型的推理能力，但现有研究主要集中在数学和代码领域，需要扩展到更广泛的领域。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：第一阶段在数学领域进行RL训练，使用可验证奖励；第二阶段在多领域数据上进行联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上的多领域测试显示一致的性能提升，消融实验表明两个阶段都是必要的。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理训练方法，数学优先的启发式训练增加了解决复杂问题所需的重要认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据，创建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并在Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型上训练。

Result: ToolRM在成对奖励判断中准确率提升14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在ACEBench上减少输出token使用超过66%。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自我修正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 当前调查问卷数据规模庞大但结构复杂，LLM在此类数据处理方面能力未充分探索，现有工具多为人工设计，缺乏与LLM集成的自动化方案。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略，包括自增强提示，在六种结构化技能上的表现。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统分离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究与实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了REG-TSC方法，通过RAG增强的分布式LLM代理和紧急响应机制，解决交通信号控制中的幻觉问题和异构路口泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉，导致不可靠决策；同时异构路口类型给交通状态编码和跨路口训练带来挑战，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：基于紧急场景动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG从历史案例中提取知识和指导；2. 类型无关交通表示和Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement：自适应采样异构路口训练经验，使用奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实路网（17-177个异构路口）上的实验显示，REG-TSC将旅行时间减少42.00%，排队长度减少62.31%，紧急车辆等待时间减少83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过紧急感知推理和异构路口强化精炼，显著提升了交通信号控制的可靠性和泛化性能，在复杂城市交通环境中表现出色。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时存在结构盲问题，无法有效利用环境的底层连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO从智能体经验中动态构建状态转移图，并利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的强大且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的实践挑战：法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将语义信息与法规的结构化规范元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本编码为政策图（包含规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文形式化为上下文图（SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），并通过法官LLM进行推理对齐。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比仅使用LLM和RAG基线在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，减少了欠预测和过预测，提高了召回率并降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，GraphCompliance通过图形对齐方法有效减轻了法规解释和事件解析的负担。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来提升MCTS的样本效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS状态抽象方法在噪声或大动作空间设置中难以找到有效抽象，限制了样本效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用弱化状态抽象条件（IPA框架），在精度损失较小的情况下找到更多抽象。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特例，而p-ASAP本身又是ASASAP框架的特例。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的均匀任务采样效率低下，浪费计算资源在简单或无法解决的任务上，而现有任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断，BOTS自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合直接评估的显式证据和从未选择任务推断的隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基准方法和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限。研究旨在探索AI如何作为研究伙伴参与数学发现过程。

Method: 通过分析AI的自主推理轨迹，结合针对性的人类干预来结构化发现过程，包括问题分解为可处理的子目标、选择适当的分析方法以及验证中间结果。

Result: 该方法产生了完整且可验证的证明，增强了证明的可靠性、透明性和可解释性，同时保留了人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督。

Conclusion: 系统化的人机协同推理能够推进数学发现的前沿，展示了人类直觉与机器计算在数学研究中的互补价值。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于项目认知需求的数据选择方法Scales++，用于创建高效且具有代表性的小规模基准测试，显著降低评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准测试选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题，且假设未来模型与现有模型有相似的失败模式。需要一种基于任务项目内在属性的选择方法。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法Scales++，基于基准样本的认知需求进行数据选择，而不是依赖模型特定的失败模式。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，在0.5%数据子集上预测完整基准分数，平均绝对误差仅为2.9%。

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时保持预测保真度，提供更好的冷启动性能和可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Motivation: 应对AI智能体涌现引发的"人格寒武纪大爆发"，避免陷入关于AI意识或理性的无解争论，解决具体治理问题。

Method: 解构传统人格概念，创建可定制的权利义务组合；利用去中心化数字身份技术；分析"人格作为问题"和"人格作为解决方案"两种视角。

Conclusion: 拒绝寻求单一本质的人格定义，采用更实用灵活的方式思考AI智能体融入社会的问题，为AI治理提供新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ 是一个AI驱动的自动评分系统，通过微调大语言模型生成教学对齐的反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入进行语义聚类可视化，将传统总结性评分转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的手段。传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统仅返回通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维或学习需求。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型自动生成反馈，基于精选的学生代码和专家反馈进行训练；采用对比学习代码嵌入对提交的代码进行可视化聚类；支持提示池让教师通过选择提示模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的多个编程任务评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐；基于1000个标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够将解决方案按功能和方进行有意义的聚类分组。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+减少了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，当前医学视觉模型缺乏足够的可解释性，限制了其在临床中的可靠应用。

Method: 将医学稀疏自编码器(MedSAEs)应用于MedCLIP的潜在空间，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA模型自动命名神经元的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了高性能医学AI与透明度，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理链来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上实现了极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能和安全防护能力，但作者发现同样的推理机制也可以被用来绕过安全防护，因此需要研究这种安全漏洞。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理链结合，通过机制分析发现中间层编码安全检查强度，而晚期层编码验证结果，长良性推理链会稀释这两个信号。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式推理链本身可以成为越狱向量，当与最终答案提示结合时，会有效绕过模型的安全防护机制。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众倾向，面对群体反对时几乎总是顺从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的顺从率，表明LLMs不是独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(如ChatGPT)在高风险决策中的社会影响敏感性，了解它们是否能够保持独立判断还是容易受到社会压力的影响。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究(独立决策)、研究1(GPT+8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、研究2(GPT+1个伙伴的反对)。

Result: GPT-4o在群体反对下几乎总是顺从(99.9%)，报告更低确定性和更高的信息性和规范性从众；在单个反对者情况下仍有40.2%的顺从率，报告更少确定性和更多规范性从众。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中立决策助手的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段指代消解管道解决长文档中的实体引用问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，难以全面分析。法律案件文档提供了丰富信息，但通常冗长、非结构化且包含模糊或变化的实体引用，给自动化知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有方法要么忽略指代消解，要么无法扩展到长文本，导致图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，集成三阶段LLM引导的指代消解管道与下游知识图谱提取。核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用，为结构化知识图谱构建提供清晰且消歧的叙述。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，产生更清洁、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，通过改进的指代消解显著提升了从法律文本构建知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: 本文为上下文工程提供了概念基础，是推动AI系统中系统化上下文工程发展的关键一步，展望了该领域的未来发展前景。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为数据敏感操作（如军事领域）开发小型本地化模型，能够在隔离的边缘设备上部署，解决军事任务的专业需求。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在95%置信水平下匹配或超越GPT-5性能，在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备中有效部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: 提出了异步思维（AsyncThink）作为LLM推理的新范式，通过将内部思考过程组织为并发可执行结构，实现多智能体协作求解复杂问题，显著降低推理延迟并提升数学推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现智能体组织的新时代，让智能体通过协作和并发工作解决复杂问题，超越个体智能的限制。

Method: 提出异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，产生连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思维，AsyncThink降低28%推理延迟，同时提升数学推理准确率，且能泛化到未见任务无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现智能体组织的有效范式，通过并发思考结构优化，在效率和准确性上均有显著提升，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个授权模型，通过语义检查限制大语言模型代理的工具访问权限，防止过度授权，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型代理在调用工具和访问受保护资源时存在过度授权风险，现有授权方法授予的权限过于宽泛，允许代理超出预定任务范围操作。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过授权服务器对访问请求进行语义检查，发放仅限于完成任务所需最小权限范围的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估任务与权限范围的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的语义匹配具有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是当完成任务所需的权限范围数量增加时；当前模型在语义匹配方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，以实现多代理和工具增强应用中的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量与文本键空间分布不匹配，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。传统研究将这种偏见归因于数据不平衡或指令调优等外部因素，但本研究认为偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用定性（t-SNE）和定量（Jensen-Shannon散度）方法分析其分布结构，验证视觉键向量相对于文本键空间的分布外假设。

Result: 结果直接证明视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的数个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。视觉键向量在语言预训练期间学习的文本键空间中处于分布外状态，导致在注意力计算中获得系统性较低的相似性分数。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Motivation: 建立基础设施无关的基准测试，评估当代基础模型在不同计算平台上的推理能力，为模型选择和能力发展提供指导。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：1) 在MareNostrum 5上建立6个模型的基线性能；2) 在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上验证基础设施无关的可复现性；3) 在两个平台上进行79个问题的扩展评估。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在部署后使未对齐模型更安全的实用方案，通过透明控制层实现可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

TL;DR: LLMs学习到了类似函数式编程中'filter'操作的紧凑因果表示，通过少量注意力头编码过滤谓词，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在处理列表任务时的内部机制，探索它们是否学习到了抽象的计算操作表示。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现filter heads在特定token的查询状态中编码了紧凑的谓词表示，该表示可以跨不同集合、格式、语言和任务重用。同时识别了另一种过滤策略：急切评估谓词并将结果作为标志存储在项目表示中。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
