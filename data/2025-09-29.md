### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构来检测大语言模型幻觉，通过自适应层间特征加权和差分特征学习机制，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，仅需1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉内容和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块进行自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制，通过计算并行编码器从相同输入学习互补表示之间的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval的问答、对话和摘要数据集上的系统实验表明，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上实现了显著的准确率提升，仅使用1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文影响力值(CI值)的RAG上下文选择方法，通过量化移除每个上下文对性能的影响来评估上下文质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在检索低质量上下文（包含不相关或噪声信息）时效果受限，而现有的上下文质量评估方法未能充分利用可用信息（查询、上下文列表和生成器）进行全面的质量评估。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新定义为推理时数据估值问题，引入上下文影响力值(CI值)来量化上下文质量，并开发参数化代理模型进行CI值预测，采用分层架构捕捉局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: 基于CI值的上下文选择方法为RAG系统提供了一种有效的上下文质量评估和选择机制，通过综合考量查询相关性、上下文独特性和生成器对齐性，显著提升了RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，差距可达99%。不同问题类型下有效窗口大小也不同，大多数模型在1000个token内就会出现严重性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的真实效果，揭示报告的最大上下文窗口与实际有效上下文窗口之间的显著差异。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型下上下文窗口的有效性，创建了标准化比较模型效能的方法来找到失效点。

Result: 收集了数十万个数据点，发现最大有效上下文窗口不仅与宣传的最大上下文窗口差异巨大，而且随问题类型变化。顶级模型在100个token内就会失效，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率严重下降。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口因问题类型而异，这为提高模型准确性和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI未来发展需要超越单纯规模扩展，需要人类符号作为指南针来引导大型语言模型的直觉能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展过度依赖规模扩展，缺乏真正的发现能力，需要引入人类符号来引导模型的直觉

Method: 提出使用人类精心设计的符号作为指南针，为大型语言模型的强大但盲目的直觉提供方向性指导

Result: 通过引入人类符号作为指导，可以解锁AI真正的发现能力，而不仅仅是依赖规模扩展

Conclusion: AI的未来发展需要结合人类符号指导与模型直觉能力，才能实现真正的突破性发现

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统调查了大型语言模型在不同语言中的道德决策差异，发现LLMs的道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多语言和多文化环境中部署，其基于英语数据预训练的模式引发了跨语言道德推理泛化能力的担忧。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，并构建研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言中的道德判断存在显著不一致，往往反映文化错位，并通过案例研究揭示了预训练数据在塑造LLMs道德指南针中的作用。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用符合ADA标准的合成病例进行测试，结果显示GPT-5与ADA标准高度一致，可作为临床医生和患者的双重工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难，而大型语言模型的发展为提供结构化、可解释的决策支持提供了机会。

Method: 使用基于ADA 2025标准和公共数据集（NHANES、Pima Indians等）构建的合成病例模拟框架，测试GPT-5在症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查等五个场景中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在病例分类、临床推理生成、患者解释和结构化JSON摘要方面表现出与ADA定义标准的高度一致性。

Conclusion: GPT-5可作为临床医生和患者的双重工具，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了在减轻语言模型性别偏见时，公平性目标与下游任务性能之间的权衡机制，发现性能下降主要由整体遗忘水平驱动，而选择性遗忘偏见会加剧整体遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能下降的根本原因，特别是在减轻性别偏见时公平性目标与下游任务性能之间的权衡机制。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角，分析性能权衡的底层机制，研究选择性遗忘偏见对整体遗忘水平的影响。

Result: 发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；选择性遗忘偏见会加剧整体遗忘；现有缓解遗忘的通用方法无法有效减少整体遗忘或改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要开发更有效的方法来平衡道德对齐与模型性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用强化学习开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型，在BIRD数据库查询基准测试中取得了最先进的结果：73.56%（无自一致性）和75.68%（有自一致性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够整合企业特定知识的自定义推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RLVR设置下。

Method: 采用简单的通用训练方法：精心设计的提示和模型选择，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD排行榜上首次提交即达到最先进水平：私有测试集准确率73.56%（无自一致性）和75.68%（有自一致性），且需要更少的生成次数。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于商业智能、数据科学和编程等企业领域。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励(RLVR)中使用混合标记生成(MoT-G)方法，通过利用模型概率分布中的丰富信息来改进语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散标记，丢弃了模型概率分布中的丰富分布信息，不必要地限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出了统一的MoT-G框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中生成思维链，包括构建混合嵌入作为标记嵌入的加权和。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码实现了5-35%的提升，且仅用一半轨迹就能达到相当精度，表明训练效率提高。

Conclusion: MoT-G的益处可能源于其在推理过程中保持更高隐藏状态熵的能力，并促进标记空间的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

### [10] [Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation: Improving Classifier Accuracy with Train-Time-Only Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21487)
*Jillian Xu,Dylan Zhou,Vinay Shukla,Yang Yang,Junrui Ruan,Shuhuai Lin,Wenfei Zou,Yinxiao Liu,Karthik Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD)方法，通过添加分类头和推理头，在训练时利用教师推理监督，测试时只使用分类头，实现高准确率的同时保持高推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提高分类准确率的同时带来显著吞吐量惩罚的问题，需要在准确率和效率之间找到平衡。

Method: 为仅解码器语言模型添加两个头：(1)池化分类头用于训练和推理，(2)推理头仅在训练时受教师推理监督。使用标签交叉熵和输入加推理序列的token级语言模型损失的加权和进行训练。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，DHRD相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对提升，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更显著。推理吞吐量与池化分类器相当，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法成功解决了CoT的准确率与效率权衡问题，在保持高推理吞吐量的同时显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）可以替代代码，而保持表面规律性的损坏代码仍能保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究代码的哪些方面对增强大语言模型推理能力最为关键，为训练数据设计提供指导。

Method: 构建10种编程语言的平行指令数据集，应用控制扰动选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在5个模型家族8个规模上微调并评估自然语言、数学和代码任务性能。

Result: 在3331个实验中，LLM对结构扰动更敏感，伪代码和流程图等抽象与代码效果相当，保持表面规律性的损坏代码仍具竞争力，不同编程语言对特定任务有不同优势。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是增强LLM推理能力的关键因素，适当的抽象可以替代具体代码，这为优化训练数据设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 印度是农业经济国家，农民需要便捷获取农业实践信息以实现最优农业增长和产出。传统呼叫中心方式存在时间和人力资源限制。

Method: 使用Kisan呼叫中心数据集，基于句子嵌入模型构建聊天机器人系统，通过消除同义词和实体提取技术提升准确性。

Result: 系统准确率从基础的56%提升至86%，能够24小时通过电子设备访问，为农民提供易于理解的农业信息。

Conclusion: 该系统能帮助农民更容易获取农业相关信息，提高农业产出，同时减轻呼叫中心工作负担，让工作人员专注于更有价值的目标。

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

*Chibuzor Okocha,Kelechi Ezema,Christan Grant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了非洲口音英语在不同领域（通用对话与临床对话）的说话人日志系统性能，发现临床语音存在显著的领域惩罚，主要源于误报和漏检错误。通过轻量级领域适应方法可以降低错误率，但无法完全消除领域差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索说话人日志系统在不同领域（特别是临床对话）的表现差异，分析领域效应的影响因素，并寻找有效的领域适应方法。

Method: 评估了多个生产和开源系统在通用和临床对话上的表现，采用严格的DER协议评估重叠语音。通过错误分析识别主要错误类型，并测试了在口音匹配数据上微调分割模块的轻量级领域适应方法。

Result: 发现临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，主要错误是误报和漏检，这与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。领域适应方法能减少错误但无法完全消除领域差距。

Conclusion: 研究指出重叠感知的分割和平衡的临床资源是实用的下一步方向，提供了跨领域基准、错误分解方法和易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种大语言模型引文生成范式：生成时引文(G-Cite)和后处理引文(P-Cite)，发现在高风险应用中推荐采用检索为中心的P-Cite优先方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律、学术和金融中，可信赖的大语言模型必须引用可验证的来源，因为即使小错误也可能带来严重后果。

Method: 引入两种引文生成范式：G-Cite在解码过程中同时生成答案和引文，P-Cite先起草答案再添加或验证引文。在四个流行的归因数据集上从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引文正确性之间存在一致的权衡，检索是两种范式中归因质量的主要驱动力。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索为中心的P-Cite优先方法，在严格声明验证等精度关键场景中保留使用G-Cite。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要识别用户偏好的细粒度差异，通过比较不同用户偏好来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum框架首先通过比较用户偏好生成结构化分析，然后利用该分析指导个性化摘要生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好差异生成结构化分析的方法能有效提升个性化多文档摘要的质量。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一套VLM作为形式化器的流水线，用于解决多模态PDDL形式化问题，在真实、多视角、低质量图像的规划任务中表现优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划中表现不足。受文本领域LLM将规划问题转化为PDDL等正式规划语言的启发，研究探索VLM在多模态环境中的形式化能力。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准上评估，并提出了两个新基准，首次考虑真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划。

Result: VLM作为形式化器显著优于端到端规划生成。瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，VLM经常无法捕捉必要的对象关系的完整集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）能部分提升性能，但增益不一致。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器在多模态规划中具有优势，但视觉能力是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示能提供部分补偿，但性能提升不一致，为未来多模态规划形式化研究留下了改进空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现虽然语法正确，但文化适应性仍是主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准过于强调语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽视了文化适应性和整体本地化质量，这对现实应用如营销和电子商务至关重要。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电子商务营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型能生成语法正确的翻译，但在文化细微语言方面表现不佳，即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 数据量不是机器翻译质量的最可靠预测指标，文化适应性应成为多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，当前基准对此关注不足。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来解决长上下文生成中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法使用静态离线学习的子空间，在数据分布变化时表现不佳，无法有效处理长上下文生成中的内存瓶颈。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留关键的首尾token作为锚点，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的极长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，与FlashAttention等现代注意力模块完全兼容。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个无需模型微调的即插即用解决方案，为内存高效的长上下文推理提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在关键应用领域引发了透明度担忧，而现有的可解释AI方法在应用于语言模型时面临诸多限制，缺乏针对不同Transformer架构的专门分析。

Method: 根据Transformer架构类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）对XAI技术进行分类整理，并通过合理性和忠实性双重标准评估这些方法的有效性。

Result: 提供了针对不同语言模型架构的XAI技术系统分类，分析了各种方法的优缺点，并建立了基于合理性和忠实性的评估框架。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战，为开发更鲁棒、透明和可解释的语言模型XAI方法指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠检测低质量评审。

Method: 提出自动化引擎重构弱点中的显性和隐性前提，构建专家标注的ReviewScore数据集，使用8个最先进LLM评估人类与模型在ReviewScore上的一致性。

Result: 验证了15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题是错误信息的；人类与LLM在ReviewScore上达到中等一致性；前提层面的事实性评估比弱点层面的事实性评估一致性显著更高。

Conclusion: 全面分歧分析支持了完全自动化ReviewScore评估的潜力。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Result: 广泛实验表明，ToG-3在深度和广度推理基准测试中均优于对比基线，消融研究证实了MACER框架各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双演进多智能体系统，能够在推理过程中自适应构建目标图索引，缓解静态一次性图构建的固有缺陷，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Conclusion: 将主动性和个性化相结合具有重要前景，ProPerSim框架和ProPerAssistant方法为开发更智能的AI助手提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Speculative Biased Decoding方法，用于流式应用中的同时翻译，通过将最近输出作为草稿并偏向草稿token来提高接受率，实现1.7倍加速并减少80%闪烁。


<details>

Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中需要持续更新输出但计算成本高的问题，避免重复从头生成输出。

Method: 使用最近输出作为草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用解决方案。

Result: 在同时文本到文本重翻译实验中，相比传统自回归重翻译实现1.7倍加速，质量不受影响，结合display-only mask-k技术显著减少80%闪烁。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了有效的加速解决方案，无需草稿计算，具有模型无关性和即插即用特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景下表现不佳，缺乏音频处理工具的使用能力，需要提升模型在噪声环境下的推理能力。

Method: 开发了Thinking-with-Sound框架，结合语言推理和实时音频域分析，让模型能够主动对音频信号进行数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在新建的MELD-Hard1k基准测试上，TwS框架显著提升了模型鲁棒性，小型模型准确率提升24.73%，大型模型提升36.61%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链能够在不重新训练的情况下显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更稳健的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLMs生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示正负或中性效果，但因果分析显示在大多数场景中结构化输出没有因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制薄弱和依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于因果推断方法，推导出五种可能的因果结构，并在七个公开和一个自建推理任务上进行测试。

Result: 在48个场景中，43个显示结构化输出没有因果影响，仅5个存在因果效应，其中3个涉及由具体指令驱动的多面因果结构。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响被粗粒度指标夸大，实际因果效应有限，具体指令可能比输出格式本身更重要。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR来改进文化感知奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估数据集，需要推进LLMs的全球对齐。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域；提出Think-as-Locals方法，通过RLVR激发生成式奖励模型的文化推理能力。

Result: 评估显示先进奖励模型在文化意识建模上存在不足，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关；Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准填补了文化意识评估空白，Think-as-Locals方法能提升文化感知奖励建模效果。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，通过添加句子切割、删除、部分摘要和代词化四种自适应动作，在保持语义保真度的同时实现实时重构、省略和简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略仅包含读/写动作，无法充分满足同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下对高质量翻译的需求。

Method: 在仅解码器的大型语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并开发延迟感知的TTS流水线来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI），并实现比参考翻译和基于分段基线更低的延迟（通过平均滞后测量）。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译动作空间为弥合人机口译差距提供了有前景的方向，特别是结合删除和句子切割动作能在流畅性和延迟之间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈解决传统方法在分布外泛化中的问题，利用因果原理而非传统似然方法，在情感分析、幽默检测等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态语言理解方法主要基于"学习注意力"范式，容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化能力下降。

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务及分布外测试集上的广泛实验证明了CaMIB的有效性。

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析进一步突出了CaMIB的可解释性和合理性，为解决多模态学习中的分布外泛化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: 语言谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅可以推广语言学，还能支持关于稀有语言的知识传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

TL;DR: 提出ResT方法，通过基于熵的令牌重加权重塑策略梯度，在工具使用任务中实现更高效的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的工具使用策略优化主要依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: 建立策略熵与训练稳定性之间的理论联系，提出ResT方法，通过熵感知的令牌重加权来重塑策略梯度，逐步增加推理令牌的权重。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中达到最先进结果，比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，在单轮任务上超过GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮任务上超过1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的令牌重加权实现了从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑转换，在多轮工具使用任务中稳定收敛，显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统在开放文本生成中面临输出可靠性判断的挑战，因为生成质量是连续的且存在多个有效响应

Method: 使用语义一致性（集成输出在意义层面的共识）作为无需训练的信号，通过模型间语义共识判断可靠性

Result: 语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低高达60%，适用于黑盒API且对模型更新具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 语义一致性为实际LLM部署提供了实用的基准方法，无需模型内部信息，跨平台有效

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在核心权衡，需要解决这一矛盾。

Method: TRACE框架将共情任务分解为分析和合成管道，通过任务分解建模共情为结构化认知过程。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在自动和基于LLM的评估中显著优于强基线。

Conclusion: 结构化分解是创建更强大和可解释共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估多轮长形式问答（MT-LFQA）的基准KnowMT-Bench，发现在多轮对话中LLMs的事实准确性和信息效率会下降，而检索增强生成（RAG）可以有效缓解这种退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，缺乏对知识密集型领域多轮长形式问答的系统评估，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 构建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置让模型生成多轮对话历史，使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验显示多轮上下文会降低性能：事实能力因自生成历史的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而降低。RAG能有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLMs在真实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要开发非线性扩展方法来提升参数高效微调的效果。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数添加结构化扰动。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN持续优于QLoRA，Sinter激活函数在消融研究中表现优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展和Sinter激活有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确和充分的上下文，仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测标记的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法高出+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持稳健，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注响应正确性不同的提示，忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，而这些提示实际上也能提供有意义的学习反馈

Method: 提出RL-ZVP算法，即使没有对比响应也能直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误，通过词元级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的细微信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61个百分点，通过率提升7.77个百分点，始终优于过滤零方差提示的基线方法

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未开发的潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这些提示中学习的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽略了用户满意度来自响应质量和交互过程的结合，无法捕捉用户体验的机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型，从可测量系统参数估计感知用户体验。

Result: QoNext不仅实现了主动和细粒度的评估，还为产品化服务提供了优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext框架成功将QoE原则应用于基础模型评估，填补了当前评估方法在用户体验机制理解上的空白。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数导致性能下降的问题，通过训练专家在多样化组合中协作，显著扩展了性能可扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数k，直觉上推理时激活更多专家(k'>k)应该提升性能，但研究发现性能在轻微增加专家数后就会快速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习到的协作。

Method: 提出EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，使MoE模型能在推理时扩展激活专家数而无需额外训练开销。

Result: 在各种MoE设置下的广泛实验表明，EMoE显著扩展了有效性能扩展范围，可达训练时k的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE通过促进专家协作和路由器优化，解决了MoE模型推理时扩展专家数的性能瓶颈，实现了更灵活的计算预算适应性和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [44] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多代理LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分性能，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性、可解释性和评分标准对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动评分中面临准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性有限和评分标准不对齐等问题，阻碍了其在评估实践中的应用。

Method: 采用双代理框架：评分标准组件提取代理从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分代理使用该表示分配最终分数。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上，AutoSCORE相比单代理基线持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），特别是在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多代理设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出SimulSense框架，通过模拟人类口译员的感知单元来改进同声传译系统的读写决策，在保持翻译质量的同时显著提升实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前同声传译系统依赖多轮对话框架、需要专门训练数据和计算昂贵LLM推理的问题，寻求更接近人类口译员决策方式的高效方法。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译，模拟人类口译员的工作方式。

Result: 与两个最先进的基线系统相比，该方法在质量-延迟权衡方面表现更优，决策速度比基线快9.6倍，实时效率显著提升。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架通过模拟人类口译员的感知单元决策机制，为同声传译系统提供了更高效、更自然的读写决策方案。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的大型语言模型在临床任务中使用CoT会导致性能下降，这与在其他领域的发现相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床领域对准确性和透明推理有严格要求，虽然CoT在其他领域能提升性能和可解释性，但其在临床电子健康记录（EHR）这种冗长、碎片化且嘈杂的文本中的有效性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 对95个先进LLM在87个真实世界临床文本任务上进行评估，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误模式，结合LLM作为评判和临床专家评估。

Result: 与先前在其他领域的研究相反，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下出现性能下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱的模型则遭受显著性能下降。

Conclusion: CoT在临床文本任务中存在关键悖论：虽然增强了可解释性，但可能损害可靠性，这凸显了需要透明且可信赖的临床推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，通过反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来减轻泰语政治立场检测中的偏见，无需微调即可提高LLMs的公平性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在泰语政治环境中，LLMs存在系统性偏见，如情感泄漏和实体偏袒，影响公平性和可靠性，特别是在低资源和文化复杂场景下。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来解耦情感与立场，减少偏见；发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集。

Result: ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并在多个LLMs上提高了公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化接地去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，通过整合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来增强LLM的学术创意生成能力，解决创意落地和确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术创意生成方面具有巨大潜力，但面临创意落地困难和确认偏误等关键挑战。

Method: 整合动机知识图谱（存储问题、挑战和解决方案三种节点类型）和Q驱动的苏格拉底创意生成器（双代理系统），通过苏格拉底式提问进行严格精炼。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在基于LLM的评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供基础动机支持和实用的创意改进步骤，显著提升了LLM创意生成的新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在黑盒API受限情况下难以应用，急需建立有效的黑盒检测方法。

Method: 通过研究LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答会产生一致响应，而非事实性回答则不一致，基于此设计黑盒检测指标。

Result: 实验表明，该指标在预测模型响应的事实性方面优于使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法简单有效，无需访问LLMs内部状态，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法获取所有关键证据，以及预构建结构化图数据的低效利用，这阻碍了对复杂查询的有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用代理式深度搜索工作流，包含六个模块的模块化框架，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。采用双通道检索策略，在基于块文本数据上进行语义查询，在结构化图数据上进行关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试中的实验结果表明，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向，通过双通道检索和模块化框架有效提升了复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 探索主题建模中被忽略的异常值是否包含有价值的信息，特别是作为新兴主题的早期信号。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在英法新闻数据集上追踪异常值随时间的变化。

Result: 发现异常值在两种模型和语言中都倾向于随时间演变成连贯的主题。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单视为噪声，而是新兴主题的重要早期指标，这一发现在不同模型和语言中具有一致性。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative

The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。传统基于概率的方法无法有效捕捉冲突或不确定信号。

Method: 引入模糊推理链(FRC)框架，整合LLM语义先验和连续模糊隶属度，实现概率推理与模糊隶属推理的显式交互，逐步将模糊输入转化为清晰可解释的决策。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理过程，并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移。理论分析和实证结果均证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: FRC为处理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 该研究为社交媒体AIGT的纵向分析提供了首个数据集和可解释的检测方法，揭示了语言特征与用户参与度的复杂关系。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET评估质量标准分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致导致评估结果不可比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NLP领域由于质量评价标准名称不一致而导致的评估结果不可比较问题，这阻碍了该领域的科学进步。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准质量评价标准名称和定义，并将其组织成层次结构。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，为现有评估建立可比性、指导新评估设计以及评估监管合规性提供了工具。

Conclusion: QCET分类法为解决NLP评估中的可比性问题提供了标准化框架，有助于推动该领域的科学进步。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

Motivation: 挑战微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观念，认为失败原因在于顺序编辑的深度优先管道导致过优化和编辑间干扰，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 1) 将微调恢复为标准广度优先（基于epoch）管道和mini-batch优化；2) 系统分析调优位置，提出LocFT-BF局部化编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的编辑，且不牺牲通用能力。

Conclusion: 澄清了长期存在的误解并引入原则性局部化调优策略，将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，通过结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，在不同压缩比下保持更好的模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 使用稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏分解，通过校准数据集优化分解以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

*Justin Vasselli,Eunike Andriani Kardinata,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过结构化对话行为表示生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的问题，提升文化相关性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常依赖英语对话的翻译，这会引入人工痕迹，降低自然度和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示框架，从抽象意图表示编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，而非直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面优于机器和人工翻译。

Conclusion: DAS框架能有效生成更自然、文化适宜的多语言对话，缓解翻译腔问题，支持跨语言灵活本地化。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成奖励模型中的解决-判断差距问题，通过同时利用模型的解决和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现生成奖励模型存在显著的解决-判断差距，即模型能够解决某些问题但无法做出正确判断，这种现象在14%-37%的查询中出现。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM的输出上同时利用解决和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式连接问题解决和评估能力。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的解决-判断差距，将模型判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用更小训练数据集的情况下实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自进化而不依赖外部模型蒸馏，成功缩小了生成奖励模型的解决-判断差距，提升了判断性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法来验证复杂数值声明，通过训练验证器模型从多个推理路径中选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别且容易发生推理漂移问题。

Method: 使用测试时计算扩展(TTS)从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制根据声明复杂度选择性应用TTS。

Result: TTS显著缓解了推理漂移问题，自适应TTS比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型能有效提升复杂数值声明的验证性能，自适应机制在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，结合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势，通过Top-K损失函数和演绎推理来改进法律条文预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测性任务中表现不佳，且不同司法管辖区的法律系统多样性导致方法缺乏普适性。

Method: Uni-LAP框架整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型，监督分类模型使用Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，大型语言模型采用演绎推理来精炼最终预测。

Result: 在多司法管辖区数据集上的评估表明，Uni-LAP始终优于现有基线方法，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP通过协同整合两种模型类型，为法律条文预测提供了一个有效且通用的解决方案，能够应对不同司法管辖区的挑战。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 通过系统回顾31个模型和21个基准测试，分析编码器专用架构和生成式架构，识别训练方法与评估目标之间的差异。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习倾向于语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据。三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，优先考虑语义一致性，但近期研究开始纳入文化相关内容。

Conclusion: 存在跨语言能力的不一致，以及训练目标与评估目标之间的差距，需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间找到更好的平衡。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域开发的模型。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到多个本体（FoodOn、SNOMED-CT、Hansard分类法），并对模型进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比表现更优，F1分数在某些本体和数据集上达到98%。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品注释语料库、发布用于推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在令牌来平衡推理效率与可解释性，结合信息瓶颈原则实现最小化但充分的推理表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示方法在大型语言模型中存在的延迟高、内存占用大以及错误传播问题，寻求在潜在推理效率与显式推理透明度之间的平衡。

Method: 采用混合方法：将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习到的潜在令牌（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量级或显式化。基于信息瓶颈原则，通过低容量瓶颈鼓励最小化，通过任务损失和计划重构损失确保充分性。

Result: 在保持或提高复杂基准测试准确性的同时，显著减少了推理过程中的可见令牌占用，实现了效率、准确性和可解释性的平衡。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架成功地在推理效率与透明度之间找到了平衡点，为复杂推理任务提供了一种更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTO通过组树优化方法解决推测解码中训练目标与解码策略不匹配的问题，通过草案树奖励和基于组的草案策略训练，显著提高接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在训练时只优化单个贪婪草案路径，而解码时使用树策略验证多个分支，这种草案策略不匹配限制了可实现的加速效果。

Method: 提出组树优化(GTO)，包含：(i)草案树奖励-采样自由目标，等于草案树在目标模型下的期望接受长度；(ii)基于组的草案策略训练-通过对比当前和冻结参考草案模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格代理进行稳健更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，GTO将接受长度提高7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3额外带来7.7%的加速。

Conclusion: 通过弥合草案策略不匹配，GTO为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>

Motivation: CoT推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但因其冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种有效的压缩方法来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 基于token弹性现象，采用多轮自适应压缩策略，逐步优化CoT的压缩深度，并为每个输入确定最优压缩方案。

Result: 相比最先进基线方法，平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟，且测试时性能可通过可解释特征可靠预测。

Conclusion: MACC证明CoT压缩既有效又可预测，支持无需重复微调的高效模型选择和性能预测，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型中上下文学习效率低、监督微调训练开销大且灵活性差的问题，探索将指令或演示直接映射到适配器参数的替代方案。

Method: 引入CompAs元学习框架，将上下文翻译成具有组合结构的适配器参数，这些适配器可以代数合并，无需重新处理长提示。

Result: 在多项选择和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于上下文学习和基于生成器的方法，特别是在扩展到更多输入时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了实用且高效的替代方案，具有较低推理成本、对长上下文不稳定的鲁棒性以及可逆编码等优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Method: 使用合成数据蒸馏框架进行大规模监督研究，比较不同规模的指令微调模型和推理模型在数学任务和通用任务上的表现，评估多项选择和开放式两种格式。

Result: 推理持续提升模型性能，通常能匹配或超越显著更大的IFT系统。虽然IFT在训练和推理成本上保持帕累托最优，但随着模型规模增大，推理模型在推理密集型和开放式任务中价值更加显著。

Conclusion: 推理模型在性能上具有竞争力，特别是在大规模模型和推理密集型任务中，能够克服IFT的性能限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

Motivation: 探讨LLM输出的语义状态，质疑其是否真正具有意义，而非仅仅模仿人类语言。

Method: 通过哲学论证方法，分析意图在语义中的作用，并反驳语义外在主义和内在主义的可能回应。

Result: 论证支持LLM输出无字面意义的结论，但承认这些输出在实用层面仍可被理解为有意义。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM输出在严格意义上无意义，但在实际使用中仍能产生看似有意义的结果，甚至帮助获取真信念和知识。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

### [72] [Question-Driven Analysis and Synthesis: Building Interpretable Thematic Trees with LLMs for Text Clustering and Controllable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22211)
*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了递归主题划分(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型构建可解释的二进制树形主题分类，比传统基于关键词的主题模型更易理解，并能用于下游分类任务和生成模型控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，且基于关键词的聚类结果需要大量人工解释，缺乏语义连贯性。需要解决这一关键的可解释性差距。

Method: 使用大语言模型交互式构建二进制树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上划分数据，形成完全可解释的分类体系。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线方法的关键词主题更易解释，这些聚类在下游分类任务中作为强大特征表现优异，特别是当数据主题与任务标签相关时。

Conclusion: RTP为数据探索引入了新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语义语音分词器对无关声学扰动脆弱，导致下游LLM学习负担增加。作者提出StableToken，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定分词，显著提升噪声条件下的单元编辑距离和SpeechLLM鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音分词器对含义无关的声学扰动极其脆弱，即使在高信噪比条件下，输出分词序列也会剧烈变化，增加下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出StableToken分词器，采用多分支并行处理音频，通过强大的位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的分词序列。

Result: StableToken在分词稳定性方面达到新的最先进水平，在各种噪声条件下显著降低单元编辑距离，并直接转化为下游SpeechLLM在多种任务上的鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: 通过共识驱动机制实现的分词稳定性对下游SpeechLLM性能有直接积极影响，StableToken为解决语义语音分词器脆弱性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出复合推理(CR)方法，让大语言模型能够动态组合多种推理风格，在科学和医学问答任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖单一推理范式，限制了在复杂问题上的表现，需要更灵活的推理策略

Method: 复合推理方法，动态探索和组合演绎、归纳、溯因等多种推理风格

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中超越CoT和DeepSeek-R1等方法，具有更好的样本效率和适当的token使用

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格多样性，大语言模型获得了更鲁棒、自适应和高效的问题解决能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反向投机解码（RSD）方法解决大模型向小模型知识蒸馏时因分布不对齐导致的性能下降问题，通过让学生模型基于自身概率分布筛选教师模型生成的推理轨迹，显著提升了小模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型知识蒸馏方法在推理能力迁移中经常失败，因为教师模型的推理轨迹包含学生模型分布中低概率的token，超出了小模型的表示能力，反而成为学习障碍。

Method: 提出反向投机解码（RSD）机制：教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验显示，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使平均性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练则提升了4.9%。

Conclusion: 低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，RSD方法能有效解决这一问题，但需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制化的分布对齐。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试无法充分评估LLM在氛围编程范式下的能力，它们要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，特点包括：纯自然语言提示、多级过滤的严格数据收集流程、包含F2P和P2P测试的全面测试用例、多样化应用领域的代码库。

Result: 评估显示氛围编程范式下的功能实现具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%。分析发现存在"激进实现"倾向，这种策略既会导致关键失败，又能产生优越的软件设计。

Conclusion: FeatBench填补了氛围编程评估的空白，揭示了功能实现的挑战性，并提供了基准测试、自动化收集流程和实验结果供社区进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是人机自然交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急情况下模型中断能力方面。

Method: 通过六个多样化的人机交互场景系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和会话效果，比较开源和商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面的表现。

Result: 发现开源模型和商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测为实现真正无缝和类人全双工交互提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

TL;DR: 该论文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出安全合规概念，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建新基准，并通过GRPO方法训练Compliance Reasoner来提升LLM安全合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。需要从法律合规角度建立更严谨的安全标准。

Method: 1. 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR开发安全合规基准；2. 使用Group Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升10.45%，GDPR平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 通过法律合规框架可以有效提升LLM安全性，Compliance Reasoner方法为LLM安全提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到LLMs的推理过程中，解决LLMs在处理知识图谱时只关注语义而忽略结构信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs处理幻觉问题的主要方法是结合知识图谱，但通常将KGs视为纯文本，只提取语义信息而忽略了关键的结构方面。另一个挑战是KGs编码器和LLMs文本嵌入空间之间的差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出了SSKG-LLM模型架构，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块、知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义的同时利用结构信息，以及知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLMs能够理解KGs嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合KGs结构信息如何增强LLMs的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，显著提升LLMs的事实推理能力，解决了现有方法只关注语义而忽略结构的问题。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available
at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常从训练数据中复制或放大社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中系统研究解释性与公平性的关系，关注编码器和仅解码器模型，考察三个维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)训练期间缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为训练中减少偏见的有用监督信号，但在候选模型中选择公平模型时不可靠。

Conclusion: 基于输入的解释在检测偏见和训练监督方面有效，但不能可靠地用于模型选择，这为公平NLP中可解释性的应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型；谓词可用性提升性能15-20%；T5模型优于更大的仅解码器LLMs；模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译被证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系的能力，以及模型规模如何影响这种能力，这对于确保大语言模型事实正确性至关重要。

Method: 生成有向图训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估其在各种图大小下推断传递关系的能力，特别关注网格图的维度对学习难度的影响。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状有向图的连通性，图维度是预测学习能力的重要指标。模型规模增大能改善泛化能力，但在多组件复杂图上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer在结构化网格图上能有效学习传递关系，但处理复杂非网格图时存在局限，模型规模扩展有助于提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to

### [86] [Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个使用大型语言模型对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越了传统文本分类，能够执行故障模式识别、因果链推理等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中的大量非结构化文本信息无法通过传统定量可靠性分析方法获取，现有机器学习方法通常只停留在分类层面，无法进行复杂推理。

Method: 引入探索性框架，利用大型语言模型进行深度语义分析，包括故障模式识别、因果链推理、站点比较分析和数据质量审计四个分析工作流。

Result: 结果表明大型语言模型可以作为强大的"可靠性副驾驶"，不仅能标记文本，还能综合信息并生成专家级别的可操作假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新颖可复现的方法论，将大型语言模型用作推理工具，为风能行业解锁非结构化数据中隐藏的洞察提供了新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2模型训练数据中的政治偏见，发现左倾文档在数据集中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的政治偏见强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见如何产生尚不清楚。需要分析训练数据中的政治内容来理解这一现象。

Method: 从OLMO2的预训练和后训练语料库中抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，并评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料包含比后训练数据更多的政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源来构建相似话题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据整理流程中整合政治内容分析，并对筛选策略进行深入记录以确保透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera是一个包含7500个高质量维基百科图表的测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型在图表理解方面的真实能力，发现当前模型主要依赖三种捷径行为而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在图表相关基准测试中表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表内容，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含7500个维基百科图表，每个图表标注语义三元组和多层次问题，评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个维度，并检测三种捷径行为。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其看似强大的性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在图表理解方面存在严重局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准测试对复杂视觉输入的真实理解能力，而非问答捷径。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

*Antreas Ioannou,Andreas Shiamishis,Nora Hollenstein,Nezihe Merve Gürel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM具有显著挑战性，准确率通常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，在多语言法律和非法律基准上评估LLaMA和Gemini，并通过字符和词级扰动测试其对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 法律推理基准LEXam上的准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务XNLI上超过70%；Gemini平均比LLaMA高出约24个百分点；语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答问题的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别无答案问题，并展示出良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在缺乏信息时仍会自信回答，导致幻觉答案。需要解决不可回答性检测问题，特别是在抽取式问答中判断段落是否包含足够信息回答问题。

Method: 识别模型激活空间中捕捉不可回答性的方向，通过在推理时应用激活加法并测量对模型弃权行为的影响来选择方向。将隐藏激活投影到该方向获得可靠的不可回答性分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法有效检测不可回答问题，比现有基于提示和分类器的方法具有更好的跨数据集泛化能力。该方向还能扩展到科学共识缺乏和主观性等其他不可回答情况。

Conclusion: 因果干预表明，添加或消融该方向能有效控制模型的弃权行为，为LLM的不可回答性检测提供了简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过监督微调或强化学习来提升LLM的问题解决能力，本文从新的视角研究LLM针对同一问题生成不同解决方案的多样性，探索解决方案分歧度与模型性能的关系。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM在多个问题域中生成解决方案的多样性，提出解决方案分歧度作为新指标，并将其应用于监督微调和强化学习策略中。

Result: 在三个代表性问题域上的实验表明，解决方案分歧度与模型问题解决能力呈正相关，使用该指标能持续提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧度是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估，为提升模型问题解决能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的FP8训练方法，通过细粒度混合粒度量化策略，在保持数值精度的同时显著提升大语言模型训练效率，实现与BF16基线相当的性能但训练时间减少22%、内存使用降低14%、吞吐量提升19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本阻碍了创新，FP8训练虽然理论上效率提升显著，但缺乏全面开源训练方案限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值保真度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方法不仅稳定性好且基本无损，在推理基准测试中性能与BF16基线相当，同时训练时间减少22%、内存使用降低14%、吞吐量提升19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以进一步普及大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex是一个神经代理框架，通过将代理置于真实词汇系统中并操纵其沟通需求来模拟语义变化，特别在颜色命名任务中展示了代理如何发展出类似人类的命名行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的词汇语义变化研究方法（观察法和实验法）存在局限：观察法无法揭示因果机制，而人类实验难以应用于历时语义变化过程。

Method: 使用神经代理框架，首先将代理置于真实词汇系统（如英语）中，然后系统性地操纵其沟通需求，通过监督学习和强化学习管道训练代理。

Result: 实验表明，经过训练以"说"现有语言的神经代理在颜色命名任务中能够显著程度地重现类似人类的模式。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架支持进一步用于阐明语义变化的机制，证明了模拟方法在语义变化研究中的有效性。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR门户中的异步患者-临床医生消息增加了临床医生工作量，LLM辅助生成回复存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 开发了包含5个领域59个错误代码的临床错误本体；构建检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-回复对；采用两阶段DSPy提示架构进行分层错误检测。

Result: 在1,500多条患者消息上测试，检索上下文改进了临床完整性和工作流程适当性等领域的错误识别；人类验证显示上下文增强标签的协议一致性(50% vs 33%)和性能(F1=0.500 vs 0.256)均优于基线。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，检索上下文显著提高了LLM生成回复的评估质量。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的训练流程，能够提升循环神经网络的长上下文召回能力和上下文学习能力，而不会显著增加模型参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时计算成本高，而RNN虽然具有恒定复杂度但在长上下文信息召回方面表现不佳。现有研究表明召回能力与循环状态大小正相关，但直接训练大状态RNN成本高昂。

Method: 针对线性注意力和状态空间模型两类流行RNN，设计了后训练架构修改来扩展状态大小，几乎不增加模型参数。在1.3B参数规模的模型上进行了实验验证。

Result: StateX能够有效增强RNN的召回和上下文学习能力，同时不会产生高昂的后训练成本或损害其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的后训练方法，解决了RNN在长上下文处理中的召回能力不足问题。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Motivation: 为语言模型的推理能力提供一个原则性的概率视角，通过变分推理框架来优化思维轨迹，并统一变分推理与强化学习方法。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式来稳定变分后验的训练，并将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励RL解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上进行了广泛的推理任务验证，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个原则性的概率视角，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法，并为提升语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略（FCP），将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过条件生成而非奖励优化来训练LLM


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题

Method: FCP从响应-反馈对中学习，通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验，并开发在线自举阶段在正向条件下生成并接收新反馈

Result: 该方法为LLM从语言反馈中学习提供了更具表达力的方式

Conclusion: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，能更直接有效地利用语言反馈

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应多分支引导（AMBS）方法，通过两阶段1对N框架实现统一高效的多目标对齐，解决传统方法中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的多目标对齐（帮助性、无害性、诚实性）对于安全可靠部署至关重要。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘（优化一个目标会覆盖其他目标）和推理碎片化（不同目标输出不一致）的问题。

Method: 两阶段1对N框架：第一阶段计算Transformer层的共享后注意力隐藏状态；第二阶段通过策略参考机制将共享表示克隆到并行分支进行目标特定控制，同时保持跨目标一致性。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验表明，AMBS在多个7B LLM骨干上持续改善HHH对齐。在DeepSeek-7B上，相比朴素1对N基线，平均对齐分数提升+32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS方法有效解决了多目标对齐中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题，在保持与最先进方法竞争力的同时，显著提升了多目标对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

### [101] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了n-gram新颖性作为创造力指标的局限性，发现虽然与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的。开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性反而与实用性负相关，前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前n-gram新颖性被广泛用于评估语言模型的文本生成能力和创造力，但创造力理论认为这忽略了创造力的双重性质：新颖性和适当性（合理性和实用性）。

Method: 通过7542个专家作家注释（n=26），对人工和AI生成文本的新颖性、实用性和合理性进行仔细阅读评估，并测试零样本、少样本和微调模型识别创造性表达和非实用性表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的。开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性与实用性负相关。前沿LLMs在识别创造性表达方面表现优于随机但仍有改进空间，特别是在识别非实用性表达方面。

Conclusion: 不应仅依赖n-gram新颖性来评估创造力，需要考虑创造力的双重性质。LLMs在识别创造性表达方面有潜力但需改进，特别是对非实用性表达的识别。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent是一个利用多级视觉反馈迭代生成和优化网站代码的智能体系统，通过视觉语言模型分析截图和GUI测试来提供质量评分，结合回溯和最佳选择机制提升性能，并使用Step-GRPO训练方法增强LLM的网站生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码生成智能体在网站代码生成任务中主要依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是视觉效果和用户交互方面。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，使用视觉语言模型分析网站截图和GUI测试结果，生成详细的文本描述、建议和质量评分；结合回溯和最佳选择机制；引入Step-GRPO训练方法，将截图和GUI智能体评分作为过程监督奖励信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升到51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升到3.9；Step-GRPO训练将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升到45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升到3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过多级视觉反馈和Step-GRPO训练方法显著提升了网站代码生成的质量和准确性，超越了现有最先进的智能体系统。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逻辑推理范式不适合处理社交情境中的模糊线索和解释性过程，需要模拟人类社交认知的新方法

Method: 1) 通过树状规划模拟人类思维的关联性和渐进性，构建认知流程数据集；2) 监督微调建立基本认知推理能力；3) 强化学习优化认知流程和响应质量

Result: CogFlow有效增强了LLMs和人类的社交认知能力，带来更有效的社交决策

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了逻辑推理在社交情境中的不足，为AI社交智能提供了新方向

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估语音优先AI助手的完整能力范围，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 设计了包含自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及异质图像观看任务的综合基准测试。

Result: 评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio，发现专有模型并非全面优于开源模型，大多数模型在说话任务上表现良好但在音频理解上落后，设计良好的小模型可与大模型竞争。

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval识别了当前模型的差距，为下一代AI助手的开发提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用LLMs定位上下文幻觉的可行性，构建了一个包含1000多个示例的基准测试，并提出了基于自由形式文本描述的新表示方法。研究发现最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.67，揭示了LLMs在该任务中的主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs定位上下文幻觉的适用性，作为现有复杂评估管线的更实用替代方案。由于缺乏针对幻觉定位的元评估基准，需要构建专门针对LLMs的基准。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个示例的基准测试，采用人类标注；提出了基于自由形式文本描述的新表示方法；评估了四个大规模LLMs；分析了最佳提示策略。

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，最佳模型仅达到0.67的F1分数；发现LLMs倾向于错误地将缺失细节标记为不一致，并且难以处理包含参数知识但源文本中不存在的事实。

Conclusion: LLMs在定位上下文幻觉方面面临显著挑战，主要困难包括错误标记缺失细节和处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本中不存在的信息。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse

deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual

performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估白盒监控器性能的系统框架，通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略来检测真正的模型行为而非表面诱发伪影，发现现有监控器性能存在显著高估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测大型语言模型有害行为方面具有优势，但现有评估方法存在信息泄露问题，导致监控器性能被高估，需要开发更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出系统评估框架，使用内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）和微调模型生物（无需显式提示即可展现欺骗行为）三种策略来评估监控器性能。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤可平滑移除诱发信号，使AUROC降低30%；分数过滤减少AUROC 15%；微调模型生物虽然改进评估但使监控器性能下降达40%，即使重新训练也是如此。

Conclusion: 现有白盒监控器性能评估存在显著高估，需要采用更严格的评估方法，特别是通过微调模型生物来避免信息泄露问题，确保监控器检测的是真正的模型行为而非诱发伪影。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的思维链推理过程难以大规模验证，需要一种能够自动验证和优化推理路径的方法。

Method: 提出决策支点概念，通过采样多样推理路径挖掘共享支点，使用辅助验证器压缩推理为支点聚焦的短路径，并进行自训练后处理。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下，有效对齐模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，EEG数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征，使用多种传统机器学习模型和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 结果整体上没有显著差异，但GNN模型在一些基本标准上表现更好，特别是在传统模型表现不佳的情况下。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，研究提供了传统模型(如SVM)与新兴模型(如GNN)在基于EEG的神经营销学中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识，自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在空间插值和不确定性量化任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的算法发现框架缺乏地理空间领域知识和多步推理能力，难以解决复杂的地理空间问题。

Method: 采用双层循环结构：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能体控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块注入地理学理论先验知识。

Result: 在空间插值任务中降低RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计中提升性能17%。消融研究证实领域知识引导的检索对稳定高质量进化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，通过深度学习提取特征并解释，使用透明Cox回归进行风险分层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤学中需要准确且可解释的生存分析方法，随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求，这一挑战变得更加复杂。

Method: MultiFIX框架使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式，风险估计采用透明Cox回归。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX获得C-index 0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法，并与已知预后标志物一致。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，MultiFIX框架具有良好应用前景。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Semantic F1 Scores，一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，通过新颖的两步精度-召回公式，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似标签即可比较任意大小的标签集。

Result: 通过理论论证和在合成及真实数据上的广泛实证验证，Semantic F1显示出更好的可解释性和生态效度。

Conclusion: Semantic F1通过为语义相关但不完全相同的标签给予部分信用，提供了更公平的评估，适用于各种任务和模态，仅需领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格本体论。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Conclusion: 该工作为具身AI系统的安全部署提供了重要基准和训练方法，提升了模型在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，利用预训练ASR模型优化低资源语言TTS系统，仅需少量配对数据和大量非配对文本即可生成高质量语音


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言TTS系统开发困难的问题，利用更易获得的ASR模型来弥补配对数据稀缺的不足

Method: 1) 使用IPA标记训练多语言TTS基础模型；2) 在目标语言少量配对数据上微调；3) 应用GRPO优化，使用预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型的多目标奖励

Result: 在低资源语言上生成可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调方法；在高资源语言上也超越DPO等离线对齐方法

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用ASR模型优化TTS系统，在低资源和高资源语言中均取得优异性能

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤作为可组合的"思想"来指导新问题，显著减少输出token数量（最多40%）、推理延迟（82%）和成本（59%），同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要推理时效率优化。

Method: 提出检索式思维（RoT），将推理步骤组织成具有顺序和语义边的思维图，通过检索查询相关节点和应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定模板，动态重用模板减少冗余探索。

Result: 在多个模型的推理基准测试中，RoT显著提升效率：输出token减少最多40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索驱动的动态模板构建，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经VRP求解器的终身学习框架LLR-BC，通过行为整合来防止灾难性遗忘，同时保持模型的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常基于预定义问题分布和规模进行一次性训练，当新任务出现时，要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能较差），要么进行微调（可能导致灾难性遗忘）。需要一种能够持续学习多个任务而不遗忘先前知识的终身学习范式。

Method: 提出了LLR-BC框架，通过决策寻求方式将新任务训练求解器的行为与缓冲区中的先前行为进行对齐，并为置信度较低的决策分配更大的整合权重，以更关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量受限车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的广泛实验表明，LLR-BC在终身学习设置下能够有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘问题，保持模型可塑性，并提高零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在连续学习多个任务的同时防止知识遗忘，并提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准，用于评估自主代理在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力。实验显示LLM代理在这些设置中表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）通常涉及长视野和部分可观测场景，需要持续的核心能力。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中设计长视野发现任务，代理必须通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理以及与环境交互来迭代揭示隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用；标准配置下仍超过35k token和60+工具调用。LLM代理在这些设置中持续表现不佳，人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 发现了代理在长视野能力上的持续差距，简单扩展在当前任务中失败。通过轨迹分析识别出8种错误类型，归因于两个主要原因：上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对推理、鲁棒性和安全性等端到端网页应用所需能力的评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准测试，涵盖8个任务类型，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估了12个MLLMs，结果显示模型在真实布局的组合推理、面对界面扰动的鲁棒性以及识别安全关键操作方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了当前MLLMs在网页理解能力上的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的GUI代理框架，通过细粒度的应用提示检索、预执行对齐检查和后执行状态反思，在无需复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下显著提升了多模态大语言模型在GUI任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更智能的决策框架来模拟人类认知过程。

Method: 提出D-Artemis框架，包含：1）细粒度应用提示检索机制；2）预执行对齐阶段（思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理）；3）后执行状态反思代理，形成完整的认知循环。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中达到新的SOTA：AndroidWorld上75.8%的成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上96.8%的成功率。消融研究证明各组件均有显著贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis通过模拟人类认知循环，在不依赖复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下，有效增强了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务上的能力，展现了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为无法获取真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于轨迹的LLM评估方法准确率有限。

Method: 使用通用推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，领域特定评估器通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，从而为GUI智能体分配更准确可验证的奖励。

Result: 在3000多个轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提升了5.3%和19.4%，与先进策略智能体集成后成功率提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动交互式奖励评估有效解决了GUI智能体奖励评估的泛化性和准确性问题，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务复杂，涉及多数据源探索和综合分析，但现有LLM在处理异构数据格式和验证分析计划充分性方面存在困难。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个关键组件：数据文件分析模块自动探索和提取各种数据格式的上下文；LLM验证步骤评估每个阶段分析计划的充分性；顺序规划机制从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直到验证通过。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code）中，DS-STAR实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要处理多个异构数据文件的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代优化和验证机制，能够可靠地导航涉及多种数据源的复杂分析任务，为自动化数据科学流程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Method: 引入决策公理建模框架，基于结构特性定义公理分类法，分析决策-评估悖论的产生机制。

Result: 发现决策公理在制定决策和评估决策之间存在结构性张力，即决策-评估悖论，这种悖论在现实公理结构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 在基于决策数据训练模型或应用公理进行决策和评估时，必须格外谨慎，以避免决策-评估悖论带来的问题。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前LLM多智能体系统的涌现行为研究缺乏可控实验的原则性方法，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特征）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个核心认知组件，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更具累积性和科学基础的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNN)和Transformer在计算图建模中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 采用层次化Transformer模拟逐步计算流程，并提出函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测分解为预测真实函数与简单局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有先前架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了学习图计算任务的更鲁棒范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DyRo-MCTS方法，将动作鲁棒性估计集成到MCTS中，用于动态作业车间调度问题，在保持低在线规划时间的同时显著提升离线学习策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业频繁到达的干扰，现有离线学习策略不完美，而在线规划因信息不完整易受扰动影响，需要提高决策的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出动态鲁棒MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境向既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态发展。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升离线学习策略性能，在线规划时间增加可忽略，在各种调度场景下始终优于标准MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现长期可持续的性能提升，为解决动态调度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，且两种方法的解释性都得到了领域专家的认可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不清楚。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM错误分类了临床有意义的变异并漏掉了真实异常值。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理的潜力，导致计划不一致和冗余通信，降低协作效率。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，主动检测潜在协调冲突并自适应通信。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，相比最强基线，通信成本降低22-60%，任务完成效率提高4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统中实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: RISK是一个用于电子商务风险管理的GUI代理框架，包含数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，在单步和多步交互任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理中需要多步骤、有状态交互的动态内容，需要专门解决方案。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集、RISK-Bench基准测试和RISK-R1强化微调框架，后者通过输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面的优化来提升性能。

Result: RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升6.8%，离线多步任务中提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，用于自动化复杂的网络交互，推动了电子商务风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现反转诅咒不是语言模型的内在缺陷，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图上训练模型，可以产生双线性关系结构，从而显著缓解反转诅咒并实现一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型的反转诅咒问题——即模型无法从已学习的"A是B"推断出"B是A"，并探索模型编辑的一致性问题。

Method: 在合成的关系知识图数据集上从头训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中的双线性关系结构，并测试模型编辑的传播效果。

Result: 训练出的模型出现了双线性关系结构，显著缓解了反转诅咒，能够推断未见过的反向事实。具有这种结构的模型在编辑时能够正确传播到反向事实和其他逻辑相关事实。

Conclusion: 反转诅咒不是语言模型的根本限制，而是表示几何的问题。在关系知识数据集上训练可以诱导双线性内部表示的出现，使语言模型在编辑后能够保持逻辑一致性。模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，还取决于被修改知识的底层表示几何。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，用于评估LLM在需要主动使用工具收集信息来解决小学数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现即使先进模型准确率也较低，并提出了基于代理推理图的改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等能力混合在一起，难以单独评估代理推理能力。需要构建一个能够专门评估LLM主动使用工具收集信息进行推理的基准。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题而不提供必要的前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，映射工具调用到最近节点构建推理路径。

Result: 即使是GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上也只能达到67%的准确率。分析发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: 提出的工具增强测试时缩放方法可以改善LLM的代理推理性能，通过添加工具鼓励模型重新访问节点。期望该基准和代理推理框架能够帮助未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面分析了可调空间，为创建具有特定推理配置的LLM以满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

TL;DR: A2R是一个非对称两阶段推理框架，通过并行探索和综合推理来弥合模型潜在能力与实际性能之间的差距，显著提升复杂问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要通过多路径推理来充分挖掘模型的内在潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：首先由"探索者"模型并行生成多个潜在解决方案，然后由"综合者"模型整合这些参考进行更精细的第二阶段推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（4B探索者+8B综合者）性能超越32B单体模型，成本降低近30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，也是现实应用中高效实用的解决方案，展示了并行推理在提升模型能力方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个相互冲突的目标，但现有复杂目标交互的问题表述无法直接应用最先进的多目标搜索算法。

Method: 提出广义问题表述，通过聚合函数优化隐藏目标，仅需适当扩展核心操作即可应用标准MOS算法。

Result: 在导航、操作、医疗系统规划、检查规划和路线规划等多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的算法比原始版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的广义问题表述支持标准MOS算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，在多种机器人规划场景中显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

TL;DR: 系统评估AI模型能耗估算工具的准确性，发现现有工具存在高达40%的误差，提出了改进指南和验证框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI快速发展对环境造成显著影响，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用但存在准确性疑问，需要系统验证其可靠性。

Method: 通过比较静态和动态能耗估算方法与真实测量数据，在数百个AI实验中建立验证框架。

Result: 现有估算方法虽然能大致反映AI能耗模式，但存在高达40%的持续误差。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续AI发展提供了能耗估算质量的实证证据，建立了透明度并验证了广泛使用的工具，提出了改进指南和可扩展的验证代码。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理的脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划器-执行器代理存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 结合结构化两级规划框架与用户行为日志任务挖掘：1）通过将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典构建高层计划；2）从用户行为日志中挖掘用户特定模式；3）将高层计划基于实时GUI上下文转化为低层动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间显著改善，在长程任务序列中保持超过60.0%的成功率，突显其在复杂多步骤工作流中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，实现了鲁棒且适应性强的GUI自动化，显著提升了复杂任务场景下的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张在医学影像机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率指标直接处理分布，而非简单多数投票，以更准确反映临床数据的真实性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性和标注者分歧，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响模型排名的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标直接处理标注分布，这些指标适用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评分或概率响应模型），计算轻量且具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名，表明传统评估方法可能产生误导性结果。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的真实特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: LLM能够生成更高效的解决方案，同时需要更少的计算资源，为组合优化领域的LLM评估提供了重要贡献和基准。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Motivation: 通用多模态大模型在医疗领域应用受限，缺乏专业知识导致回答不确定或产生幻觉，知识蒸馏难以捕捉放射学和药理学等专业领域知识，大规模医疗数据持续预训练计算成本高昂。

Method: 结合通用和医疗多模态数据，提出五维质量评估框架筛选高质量数据集；采用低到高图像分辨率和多模态序列打包提高训练效率；使用三阶段监督微调确保复杂医疗任务的有效知识提取。

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域特定知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域提供更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优有限状态自动机表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代状态空间模型使用结构化转移矩阵限制了表达能力，而无结构矩阵计算成本过高，需要平衡表达能力和计算效率

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵和复值对角矩阵的乘积，使并行扫描计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系

Result: 在FSA状态追踪任务中显著优于现有SSM变体，在时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当，能有效追踪复杂FSA状态

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优FSA表达能力，为SSM提供了新的结构化参数化方法

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种更简单的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，相比现有方法更直接适用于任何黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，要么没有字面解释LLM，要么没有按意图解释LLM。需要一种基于LLM预期语义的更简单方法。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，而不是确定性因果模型，从而生成反事实。这种方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用，无需修改。

Result: 新方法比现有方法更简单，且对实现细节不可知，直接适用于任何黑盒LLM。

Conclusion: 为LLM中的反事实推理提供了理论基础，基于预期语义，为特定应用的新型反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Motivation: 受人类认知双过程理论启发，旨在让LLM更贴近人类认知过程，在效率和准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用多智能体架构：先由快速思维智能体生成初步答案，若检测到不确定性则触发System 2推理管道，包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体。

Result: 实验显示PRIME使开源LLaMA 3模型在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，能够与GPT-4、GPT-4o等闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为需要复杂知识密集型推理的领域提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够显著提升LLM的推理性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，需要解决数据稀缺问题以实现VLA模型的鲁棒泛化。

Method: 提出EMMA框架，包含DreamTransfer（基于扩散Transformer的多视角一致视频生成）和AdaMix（硬样本感知训练策略）。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面优于现有方法；在零样本视觉域的真实机器人操作任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和自适应训练策略，有效解决了机器人操作数据稀缺问题，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Result: 实证结果显示，EST策略促进了更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT策略培养了更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指出了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，通过感知-推理-动作循环将几何问题解决转化为交互式过程，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在几何推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将几何图形视为静态图像处理，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图形抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图动作模块执行辅助线绘制或变换操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调+强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试中，相比静态感知方法，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率。

Conclusion: 通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Conclusion: 赋权是评估复杂开放式环境中LM智能体的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Conclusion: TrueGradeAI通过结合手写保留和可解释的自动化评分，推进了数字考试领域，有效减轻评分偏见，确保评估公平性。

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了REMA框架，通过分析语言模型内部表示的几何结构来理解推理失败的原因。定义了"推理流形"概念，量化错误表示与正确推理流形的几何偏差，定位推理链开始偏离的关键点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型如何进行复杂推理以及失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确推理流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪各层的偏差变化来定位推理链偏离点。

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，以及错误与正确推理表示之间的高度可分性，证明了REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究首次发现不同大语言模型在利己和利他倾向上存在内在异质性，提出了两种社会行动逻辑原型：适应性利己主义者和利他主义优化者，为社交模拟中的模型选择提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽视了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现机制，需要理解LLM智能体所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标间进行抉择；采用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码智能体推理过程。

Result: 发现LLM存在两种社会倾向原型：适应性利己主义者默认优先考虑自身利益，但在社会规范影响下利他行为显著增加；利他主义优化者表现出固有的利他逻辑，即使损害自身利益也持续优先考虑集体利益。

Conclusion: 社交模拟中的模型选择不仅是推理能力的选择，更是内在社会行动逻辑的选择。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，而利他主义优化者更适合模拟理想化的亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自进化框架，通过生成式过程监督解决大语言模型在运筹学问题中的局限性，采用策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题（正确答案可能强化错误推理），传统判别式过程监督短视且无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: 提出StepORLM框架，包含策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，采用双重反馈机制（外部求解器的结果验证和GenPRM的全面过程评估），通过加权直接偏好优化对齐策略并同时精炼GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大的通用过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化机制有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，证明了该框架在提升LLM解决复杂问题能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的基于token的多模态交互编码框架，通过紧凑的token化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容性的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流水线中会导致重复退化，无法满足多模态人机协作的需求。

Method: 采用紧凑的token化表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用型、掩码型和文本条件型）来最小化token间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、外延和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

*Yixuan Han,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了动态专家搜索（DES），一种基于MoE架构的测试时扩展策略，通过动态调整激活专家数量来生成多样化的推理路径，无需额外成本即可提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现调整激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这为测试时扩展提供了新的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样化推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持专家数量一致，在路径间变化以平衡稳定性和多样性）。

Result: 在多个MoE架构、验证器和推理基准（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于其他测试时扩展基线方法，在不增加成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知测试时扩展方法，展示了现代LLMs结构灵活性如何推动推理能力的进步。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现RL通过探索避免SFT的伪相关解，但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持多样性并防止奖励破解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度(PG)和Q学习方法在规划任务中的理论特性，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：SFT会产生基于共现的伪解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持输出多样性并避免奖励破解。

Conclusion: 探索是RL实现更好泛化的关键机制，Q学习在保持多样性和避免奖励破解方面优于PG，但需要精心设计奖励函数。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.
