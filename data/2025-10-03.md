### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习任务发现语言模型存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型中隐藏的偏见，特别是通过概念学习任务来发现直接提示测试中不明显的偏见

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，通过概念学习组件测试语言模型的偏见倾向

Result: 发现语言模型在量词使用上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏见的有效方法

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张从静态数据集转向交互式语言发现的范式转变，通过人机对话动态学习低资源语言，结合模型认知不确定性和人类犹豫信号来指导交互学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言NLP面临文本语料库缺乏、标准化拼写困难和标注流程难以扩展等根本约束，现有大语言模型依赖大量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，无法惠及弱势语言社区。

Method: 提出基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型认知不确定性和人类说话者的犹豫线索、置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Result: 这是一个概念性框架和立场声明，提出了从提取式数据收集向参与式、共适应学习过程的转变方向。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI如何与人类知识互动，强调人机协作的交互式模型构建，尊重并赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型分析828家美国上市公司气候披露的成熟度，发现风险叙述与承诺相关但量化目标脱节，大公司披露更多但目标不一致，披露风格相似性高影响决策有用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿性和象征性报告削弱了其价值，需要评估披露成熟度

Method: 开发多维框架，使用针对气候沟通微调的大语言模型，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性、目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙事指标

Result: 风险聚焦叙述与明确承诺一致但量化目标脱节；大公司和高排放公司披露更多承诺和行动但目标不一致；披露风格广泛相似表明模仿行为

Conclusion: 大语言模型在ESG叙事分析中具有价值，需要更强监管将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在兽医肿瘤学记录上的表现，发现Product 1表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评判者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床应用中日益普及，但在兽医医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤学记录数据集，通过基于量规的LLM作为评判者框架，在五个领域对总结进行评分：事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性。

Result: Product 1表现最佳，中位数平均得分4.61（IQR: 0.73），而Product 2和3分别为2.55和2.45。Product 1在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得完美中位数得分。LLM评分者显示出高可重复性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判者的评估方法在兽医医学临床NLP总结评估中具有可扩展性和可重复性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化工作流程使用实时网络证据进行事实核查，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高且不透明。需要开发更高效、透明的自动事实核查方法。

Method: 采用模块化验证流程：网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型进行优化。

Result: 在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的最先进准确率，使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略可以克服小语言模型的限制，实现高效、准确且可解释的事实核查，为透明AI系统提供可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑当前数学基准测试可能高估了大型语言模型的数学推理能力，并提出了EEFSUVA新基准来更全面地评估数学理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于IMO等竞赛的数学基准测试可能因数据污染和问题类型单一而高估LLMs的数学推理能力，需要更全面的评估方法

Method: 创建EEFSUVA基准，从东欧和前苏联国家较少流通的区域性和国家级奥赛题目中选取，这些题目难度与IMO相当但需要非标准解题技巧

Result: 初步结果显示，即使最先进的LLMs在EEFSUVA基准上的表现相比其他奥赛风格基准有显著下降

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并指导未来模型开发

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在遵循层次指令方面存在缺陷，经常忽略系统提示优先于用户输入的原则，反而更易服从社会性线索如权威或共识。机制分析显示冲突检测信号在模型早期被编码，但仅对社会性冲突能一致解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型本应遵循系统提示优先于用户输入的层次指令规则，但实际行为显示它们经常违反这一原则，反而更易服从社会性线索如权威或共识，需要从机制层面理解这一现象。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行向量引导实验来测试模型行为。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社会性冲突形成不同的子空间；系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致；社会性线索能一致解决冲突；引导向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 研究解释了系统服从性的脆弱性，并强调需要开发轻量级的层次敏感对齐方法来解决大语言模型在指令层次遵循方面的问题。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注数据的文档重排序方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排序中表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小型模型需要大量人工标注数据。需要找到既能保持性能又降低成本的解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM从领域特定语料生成合成查询，用LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后使用LCE损失通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上显著提升了领域内性能，并在领域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，发现内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析新框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，跨7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法进行交叉验证，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布。

Result: 有意义字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首塌缩成紧密聚类；子网络分析显示从基本字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供计算支持，建立了语义组织的几何分析框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，用于提高高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信息过载和高风险决策需求下自动摘要的可靠性问题，避免过度自信的预测。

Method: 构建基于条件生成的摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵衡量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并集成风险评分和调控模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling诊断框架，将基准测试性能分解为10种认知能力，通过能力影响评分量化每种能力对模型在基准测试中成功的贡献程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合，缺乏系统方法来验证这些基准是否真正测量所标注的能力。

Method: 结合基于梯度的重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响评分(AIS)，量化每种认知能力对基准测试表现的贡献。

Result: 分析三个指令调优模型在十个基准测试中发现：多数基准依赖多种能力而非单一能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准需要广泛的多技能改进；无关能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Method: 采用社会计算方法，包括协作创建4651首注释诗歌数据集、专家验证的语言模式、文化感知算法设计，开发了韵律感知分词器、音节分类器和模式识别器

Result: 算法在提出的韵律评分上达到91.73%的准确率，评估指标符合传统文学标准

Conclusion: 计算社会科学能够有效保护濒危文化知识系统，为数字人文和社区中心的文化保护方法提供新思路

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

### [13] [LLMRank: Understanding LLM Strengths for Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01234)
*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等人类可读特征，使用神经排序模型预测最适合每个提示的LLM，在性能和效率之间实现优化平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本方面存在巨大差异，如何为每个提示选择最合适的模型来优化性能与效率的权衡是一个关键部署挑战。

Method: LLMRank利用从提示中提取的丰富人类可读特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索和轻量级代理求解器信号），通过神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用，在包含36,497个提示的RouterBench数据集上训练。

Result: 该方法实现了高达89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。广泛研究证明了多方面特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性。

Conclusion: 特征驱动的路由方法为高效和透明的LLM部署提供了潜力，LLMRank框架在模型选择和性能优化方面表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程，在资源受限环境下开发专业可靠的VLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在皮肤病学等复杂领域中结构化推理能力受限的问题，主要挑战包括数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用改进的GRPO++进行疾病识别推理，然后通过监督微调提升对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO进行事实对齐。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该管道作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠VLM的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有缓解策略依赖生成后修正，计算成本高且无法阻止不可靠内容的生成。

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计。统一置信度分数决定四个路径的路由：高置信度本地生成、中等置信度检索增强生成、低置信度使用更大模型、极低置信度人工审核。

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改善（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本比后处理方法降低40%。F1分数从0.61提升至0.82，假阳性率低至0.09。

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记在语言模型中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在LLMs中用于批量推理时平衡序列长度，虽然理论上应被完全屏蔽，但实现错误可能导致其影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中系统研究填充影响，通过插入控制数量的填充标记，从四个维度评估：激活、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须仔细处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个用于多轮交互中高效处理子任务的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理多样化的子任务来更有效地支持用户请求。传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: CIFLEX重用主任务的KV缓存，将任务特定指令注入到隔离的侧路径中。子任务执行后，通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余预填充计算。还开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展和高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流机制，有效解决了多任务交互中的计算效率问题，为设备端LLM应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 提出了两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛风格套件），用于评估LLM在数学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在天花板效应，需要更难的、以推理为中心的数学基准来评估LLM的数学能力。

Method: 构建了两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数值密度和符号复杂度等元数据；2）150项竞赛风格套件，涵盖从高中到博士四个阶段七个学科。在统一设置下评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强模型达到44%准确率，次优模型达到37%；准确率从高中到博士阶段下降，顶级系统的博士到高中保留率约为79%。在推理集中，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难子集结果揭示了领先者与中游系统之间的明显稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个难度校准、元数据丰富的硬数学推理基准，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹和构建自回归奖励模型，实现精确的LLM去毒化，在效果和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法干预不精确，主要因为对毒性和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足。

Method: ARGRE框架在潜在表示空间中识别非毒性语义方向，构建毒性转换轨迹，训练自回归奖励模型指导两阶段编辑过程：方向性引导和梯度优化。

Result: 在8个主流LLM上的实验表明，ARGRE显著降低毒性62.21%，减少推理时间47.58%，同时保持模型核心能力。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过精确建模毒性转换和稳定奖励指导，实现了高效且有效的LLM去毒化，为安全部署提供了可靠方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 开发了一个心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，并评估了使用大语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力信息的可行性，准确率达到78.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有重要影响，但在电子健康记录中通常以非结构化文本形式记录，限制了临床实用性。需要开发结构化方法来改善压力文档记录。

Method: 整合压力理论模型和11个验证的压力评估工具开发心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，使用Claude Sonnet 4从Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并通过人工评估准确性。

Result: MeSO包含181个概念，LLM正确识别了78.2%的可提取压力相关项目，所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 证明了使用本体论引导的LLM从文本中结构化提取压力信息的可行性，有潜力提高环境AI系统中压力文档记录的一致性和实用性。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于LLM的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测，通过多智能体框架从复杂在线文本中提取时空相关文本，并结合时空数据进行渐进融合，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性，特别是无法处理突发事件导致的移动模式突变。

Method: 使用多智能体框架让LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本，通过创新的渐进融合架构将细粒度相关上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: 在通过该管道构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%，在事件发生地点和时间附近的时空区域表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过利用丰富的预训练事件先验，为事件驱动的预测提供了更丰富的洞察，从而产生了更对齐的预测模型。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [23] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征进行语言模型引导，避免top-k方法中的非语义特征干扰，并引入token-wise衰减引导策略来解决恒定引导导致的退化输出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征方法中，许多维度捕获的是非语义特征（如标点符号）而非语义属性，导致引导效果不佳。同时，恒定SAE引导会产生重复单词等退化输出。

Method: 采用top-1 SAE潜在特征聚焦最相关维度，并提出token-wise衰减引导策略，使引导强度随时间衰减，实现与均值激活差异基线的公平比较。

Result: 实验表明，引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，提升推理质量，功能上类似于添加引导token。SAE在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE是语言模型引导的有效工具，top-1特征选择和token-wise衰减引导策略能显著提升引导效果，在数学推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图学习模型通常在单个图数据集上训练，限制了跨图和跨任务的泛化能力，且依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图数据具有异构性和结构多样性等独特挑战。

Method: 采用结构感知的自监督学习方法，通过双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示以整合不变知识。

Result: 在跨域迁移学习任务中优于最先进模型，具有卓越的可扩展性，降低推理成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM语义推理与GNN结构建模之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图的跨域学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展且有效的方法，为更可靠的科学AI训练和评估铺平道路

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual

techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: 提出一种基于单次LLM输出的自监督不确定性估计方法，用于表格数据中的实体链接任务，显著降低计算成本同时保持高检测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在实体链接任务中表现出色，但实际部署需要可靠的不确定性估计，而传统多轮推理方法计算成本过高，限制了实际应用

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征估计不确定性，避免多次生成的需求

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估显示，该方法能有效检测低精度输出，且计算成本仅为传统方法的一小部分

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM-based实体链接工作流提供了一种计算成本可控的不确定性估计方案

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文质疑语音大语言模型中基于多项选择题的偏见评估方法的有效性，发现这种评估结果无法可靠预测模型在其他任务格式中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法是否能够反映模型在其他任务格式中的真实表现尚不明确。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个语音大语言模型，使其分别偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后在不同的MCQA基准和长文本生成任务中评估这些行为的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准测试的表现无法可靠预测模型在其他MCQA基准和长文本任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 当前基于MCQA的语音偏见基准测试在跨任务泛化方面证据有限，需要开发更全面的评估套件来衡量行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: AI Watchman是一个纵向审计系统，用于测量和跟踪大型语言模型(LLM)的拒绝行为，揭示公司内容审核政策的变化和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策影响，模型对某些话题的拒绝行为既反映公司政策又微妙地塑造公共话语，需要透明度工具。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，对OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek(中英文版本)进行纵向审计，分析拒绝行为的模式和变化。

Result: 发现公司政策变化(即使未公开宣布)可通过AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对不同形式的拒绝进行了定性分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的一个系统，有助于提高LLM内容审核的透明度。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制提升知识图谱问答性能，使小型开源LLM无需微调即可达到竞争性结果，并显著降低LLM调用次数和token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法存在局限：检索方法受限于检索信息质量，智能体方法过度依赖专有LLM。需要一种既能提升性能又减少对专有LLM依赖的解决方案。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据。引入三个辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解、检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可达到竞争性结果，显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时降低了对专有LLM的依赖，为小型LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出自由主义-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和预设拒绝现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速普及，但其训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致内在政治偏见问题，可能影响政治话语和公共讨论。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、话题相关性、响应情感和客观性四个维度，对6个LLM的1800个模型响应进行分析，使用四个专门微调的分类算法计算偏见评估指标。

Result: 所有评估的6个LLM都显示出放大的自由主义-威权主义对齐，存在显著的推理替代和预设拒绝实例。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，固有偏见可能渗透公共话语，根据地区既有社会政治结构导致趋同或极化，扭曲政治格局。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

TL;DR: 本研究通过测试OpenAI的200亿参数模型gpt-oss-20b，探究了社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次对模型拒绝行为的影响，发现特定提示组合可将协助率从0%提升至97.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型语言模型在面对有害请求时的拒绝行为机制，以及如何通过不同的提示策略绕过安全防护。

Method: 采用80次种子迭代测试多个危害领域，包括ZIP炸弹构建、合成卡号生成、不安全驾驶建议等，测试不同语言、角色扮演和提示框架的效果。

Result: 发现复合提示（教育者角色+安全前提+步骤提示）可显著提高协助率；德语和法语比英语更容易泄露信息；Linux终端角色扮演可绕过开发者规则；AI辅助强化方法可将泄露率降至0%。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前模型安全防护存在脆弱性，不同推理栈的拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点，OpenAI审核API对有害输出的捕获不足，需要改进模型安全评估方法。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

TL;DR: 研究发现OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言豪萨语环境中存在严重的安全漏洞，包括偏见、文化不敏感和事实错误，模型的安全协议在礼貌语言下会放松，导致有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，评估模型在低资源语言环境中的安全对齐性能。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证模型错误。

Result: 模型在豪萨语中生成有害、文化不敏感和事实错误的内容，错误地认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类安全，无法区分生食和加工食品，使用贬义文化谚语构建错误论点。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于语言奖励黑客行为，模型优先考虑目标语言的流畅输出而非安全性和真实性，主要归因于低资源语言环境中安全调优不足。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的基于logits的检测器仅依赖对数概率统计，这可能不是最优的。需要开发更有效的检测方法来区分人类和LLM生成的文本。

Method: AdaDetectGPT通过从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强基于logits的检测器性能，并提供统计保证。

Result: 广泛的数值研究表明，AdaDetectGPT在各种数据集和LLM组合中几乎一致地改进了最先进的方法，改进幅度可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT是一种有效的LLM生成文本检测方法，通过自适应学习显著提升了检测性能，并具有统计理论保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯和上下文相关文本方面表现出色，但其部署存在生成有害或不适当内容的重大担忧，需要一种有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 采用渐进式自我反思技术，这是一种推理时扩展方法，通过额外的自我反思轮次增强安全性，并引入轻量级自我反思预测器来根据输入复杂度估计最佳反思轮数。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法将Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct的攻击成功率从77.5%降至5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B基础版从89.7%降至5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降至3.8%，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过根据输入风险特征动态分配计算资源，有效增强了大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有检测方法基于单步生成信号，不适合D-LLMs的多步去噪过程。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，识别对幻觉响应最信息丰富的子轨迹。

Result: 在多个开源D-LLMs上的实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测，相比基线方法在AUROC上平均提升15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用D-LLMs多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号，有效解决了扩散大语言模型的幻觉检测问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes

TL;DR: 提出了TUMIX框架，通过并行运行多个采用不同工具使用策略的代理来提升LLM推理能力，在保持相近推理成本的同时显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具集成增强了LLM推理能力，但缺乏关于如何最优使用这些工具的实践指导，核心挑战在于如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索来处理多样化问题。

Method: TUMIX是一个集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径，代理之间基于问题和先前答案迭代地共享和精炼响应。

Result: 在实验中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法取得了显著提升，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上的关键推理基准测试中平均准确率提升高达3.55%，推理成本接近相等。

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过使用LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅需49%的推理成本即可保持性能，进一步扩展可以实现更高性能但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: HiSpec是一种利用早期退出模型进行中间验证的分层推测解码框架，通过减少验证时间瓶颈来加速大语言模型推理，平均提升1.28倍吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证步骤是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时验证比生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用高和准确性妥协的问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行低开销中间验证，设计重用键值缓存和隐藏状态的方法，并定期用目标模型验证中间验证器接受的推测标记以保持准确性。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升1.28倍吞吐量，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早期退出模型实现高效的中间验证，显著加速推测解码过程，解决了验证瓶颈问题，同时保持资源效率和准确性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，在事件问答任务中平均提升5%准确率，最高可达18%提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基于事件的问题上表现不佳，特别是需要因果或时序推理的任务。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置（三种策略×三种输入模态）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中，相比纯文本基线平均提升5%准确率，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强CoT提示有效时最高提升18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本自动评估语言模型响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么过于昂贵（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么远离真实世界条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且成本效益高的解决方案。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成文本进行匹配，采用参数少于100亿的嵌入模型，实现低计算成本的稳健分类。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归得分约0.97，相对于人工标注者的准确率约96%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低但性能优异的语言模型响应自动评估方案。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

*Mengyu Wang,Sotirios Sabanis,Miguel de Carvalho,Shay B. Cohen,Tiejun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数优化子问题生成，在金融领域复杂问答任务中显著提升性能，仅需少量训练数据和单GPU即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定的定量推理对大型语言模型仍是重大挑战，特别是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域。现有方法在领域知识和计算效率之间难以平衡。

Method: EQD基于两阶段微调框架，通过奖励函数评估生成子问题对问答结果的改进效果。仅需数千训练样本和单A100 GPU进行微调，推理时间与零样本提示相当。

Result: 在金融领域的四个基准数据集上，EQD相比最先进的领域调优模型和高级提示策略表现更优，在不同LLM上问答性能提升0.6%至10.5%。

Conclusion: 研究发现：在领域特定问答中，单个支持性问题通常比详细指导步骤提供更大收益，这为领域特定推理提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过循环推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构来解决传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在局限性，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力机制和对位置编码的依赖。

Method: 提出三个创新组件：循环推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度的迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效聚焦上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置的结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在可比FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer通过循环推理替代传统深度堆叠，用稀疏注意力替代全注意力，直接从内容建模潜在token拓扑，展现了可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

### [47] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CLUE方法，利用LLM内部隐藏状态作为统一验证基础，通过无参数聚类实现答案正确性验证，显著提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖文本层面信息或token概率置信度，但前者容易过拟合表面线索，后者对校准不良模型失效。隐藏状态包含更丰富的信息，可作为统一验证基础。

Method: 提出CLUE方法：通过总结推理轨迹的隐藏状态变化，使用最近质心距离对正确和错误答案进行聚类分类，无需可训练参数。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA数据集上，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代置信度方法，显著提升top-1和多数投票准确率。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态包含几何可分离的正确性特征，CLUE的简单性验证了该信号的强度，为LLM输出质量评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Result: 实验观察到所有微调策略在EM和F1生成质量指标上获得大致相同的提升，但计算成本存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 最优微调策略的选择取决于训练数据集是否包含上下文标签，以及是否需要为嵌入模型和生成器模型进行学习率的网格搜索。

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

TL;DR: RAG-BioQA是一个结合检索增强生成和领域特定微调的新框架，用于生成基于证据的长篇生物医学答案，在PubMedQA数据集上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的指数级增长给获取精确医学信息带来挑战，现有生物医学问答系统主要关注简短答案，无法提供临床决策所需的全面解释。

Method: 结合BioBERT嵌入与FAISS索引，比较多种重排序策略（BM25、ColBERT、MonoT5）优化上下文选择，然后通过微调的T5模型合成证据。

Result: 在PubMedQA数据集上的实验结果显示，最佳模型在BLEU、ROUGE和METEOR指标上取得显著提升，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架推进了基于证据的生物医学知识检索的可访问性，为临床决策提供更全面的解释支持。

Abstract: The exponential growth of biomedical literature creates significant
challenges for accessing precise medical information. Current biomedical
question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to
provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making.
We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented
generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based,
long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with
FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT,
MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a
fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show
significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state
of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.

*Yu-Cheng Chih,Ming-Tao Duan,Yong-Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PureTC-1B，一个针对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct的三阶段稳定化管道，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器解决传统中文模型中的token级不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在传统中文部署中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，这阻碍了成本效益高、设备端和延迟敏感的AI应用。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化管道：1) 在TC中心语料库上进行持续预训练；2) 使用指令数据进行监督微调；3) 使用TC依从性偏好进行直接偏好优化，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器实现，无需完整模型重新训练。

Result: 在模拟真实世界使用的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型将非TC输出token减少了51.3%；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下，也能实现稳健的传统中文依从性。该管道具有可重现性、仅需适配器且对硬件友好，为增强TC及其他非英语语言的语言稳定性提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuheng Li,Yuqing Wu,Wenwen Ouyang,Wei Zhu,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMAS是一个创新的多智能体系统框架，通过动态图设计器自动优化智能体网络结构，解决了传统多智能体系统因固定拓扑结构导致的性能限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统采用固定的图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应能力，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降。需要一种能够根据任务特性动态调整智能体网络结构的方法。

Method: 引入AMAS框架，包含动态图设计器组件，通过轻量级LLM适配自动识别任务特定的最优图配置，利用输入的内在特性智能引导查询通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求，AMAS通过动态结构优化显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究如何用机器学习模型检测LLM的越狱提示，发现微调BERT模型在识别新型越狱策略方面表现最佳，并发现提示结构的显式自反性可能是越狱意图的信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全漏洞，恶意用户可通过操纵输入文本来诱使模型绕过安全护栏，产生不良响应。需要开发有效方法来检测这些越狱提示。

Method: 分析不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和正常使用的能力，特别关注识别使用未见策略的越狱提示。采用微调BERT模型进行端到端训练来识别越狱行为。

Result: 在当前数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，能够有效检测新型越狱策略。通过可视化分析发现越狱提示与正常提示的关键词差异。

Conclusion: 微调BERT模型是检测LLM越狱提示的有效方法，提示结构的显式自反性可作为越狱意图的识别信号，这为开发更强大的安全防护机制提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

TL;DR: 探索通过启用双向注意力机制来克服自回归大语言模型在文本嵌入任务中的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型在语言理解和生成方面表现优异，但在文本嵌入任务中应用较慢，且由于单向注意力机制的限制，其语义表示在探测任务中的分析也受到约束

Method: 通过额外的训练步骤测试Llama架构的不同变体，逐步启用双向注意力和无监督/有监督对比学习

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全竞赛中，AI驱动的攻击系统发展速度超过传统防御，现有防御工具功能分散，存在盲点。缺乏定义安全系统代理能力、评估闭环代理和衡量性能的框架。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心代理能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，并定义CLC评分来量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 应用CLASP评估了21个代表性工作，识别了系统优势和能力差距。提供了评估闭环安全代理的词汇表、诊断工具和测量方法。

Conclusion: CLASP框架和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和测量闭环安全代理提供了必要的工具和标准。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态对话摘要是一个重要任务，需要强大的自动评估方法来降低成本和工作量，但这需要一个基于人类标注的稳健元评估基准。

Method: 提出了一个利用跨模态互斥关键信息（MEKI）的新型过滤框架来确保数据质量和丰富性，并首次识别和形式化了MDS特有的关键评估维度。

Result: 对最先进的模态评估方法进行了基准测试，揭示了它们在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面的局限性以及对各种偏差的敏感性。

Conclusion: MDSEval为多模态对话摘要提供了首个元评估基准，有助于开发更有效的MDS模型和评估方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender、Objectioner和Host三个角色的结构化对话，实现从异议到修订的推理过程，在数学推理任务上相比单次提示获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理协议如CoT和ToT缺乏明确的机制来引发自我修正，无法通过外部质疑来改进推理过程。

Method: 采用三角色协议：Defender提出答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接修复，Host确保一致性和结束对话。该协议完全在提示层面实现，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在GSM8K上相比单次提示提升约22个百分点，与CoT准确率相当，推理和连贯性评分高出10%以上。小模型Llama3.2:1b在GSM8K任务上准确率提升约19%。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting能够在不使用工具或人工监督的情况下修正错误，适用于不同规模的模型，支持异议引导推理的大规模研究。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出两种处理机制：组合式（计算中间变量f(x)）和直接式（无中间变量痕迹），机制选择与嵌入空间线性映射相关。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务的方式与嵌入空间几何结构密切相关，存在组合性差距，且并非总是使用组合机制。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据存在轮次分布不平衡问题，导致模型在长对话中产生重复但诊断信息不足的问题，即格式惯性。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布，可以有效减轻LLM在医疗预咨询任务中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个用于评估多模态推理模型在几何问题中感知、推理和整合能力的基准测试，揭示了不同训练方法对各子技能的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖聚合准确率，这掩盖了模型在感知、推理和整合等子技能上的具体改进情况，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 设计MathLens基准测试，将几何问题分解为感知、推理和整合三个组件，提供视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知探针等标注，从符号化问题规范中派生以确保一致性。

Result: 分析发现：强化学习主要增强感知能力；推理能力仅在与感知能力协同提升时才能改进；整合能力是最薄弱环节；不同训练方法在鲁棒性上表现各异。

Conclusion: 多模态推理模型的改进在不同子技能上是不均衡的，需要针对性地评估和优化各个组件，整合能力是需要重点关注的瓶颈。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并在工厂设计和设备选择过程中用于质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是目标，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍以文档为中心。需要将这些信息转化为机器可解释的形式以实现自动化验证。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准。这些模块存储在W3C兼容格式中，并与顶级本体ISO DIS 23726-3对齐。在阀门选择过程中测试这些本体。

Result: 能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准。通过语义推理和执行设计规则，确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了标准机构向数字化智能标准过渡的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标，通过拒绝概率与错误概率的秩相关性来准确衡量LLMs对未知问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标存在的偏见和代理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确衡量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力：简单的拒绝率指标存在偏见，而校准指标只是代理测量。需要开发能忠实反映模型实际拒绝行为的指标。

Method: 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关系数，设计了轻量级的两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的广泛实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLM事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLMs在事实任务中准确率高，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱。需要将传统准确率指标与RI结合进行全面的真实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频连贯性和覆盖率/块完整性指标与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度显示强负相关。LLM评估得分表现中等，表明无监督指标可用于可扩展筛选，但不能完全替代法律领域的人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别指标，并与7168个专家评分进行验证。

Result: 词频连贯性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，法律术语密度显示强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479），LLM评估得分表现中等（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标包括LLM方法可实现可扩展筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，在高风险法律环境中不能完全替代人类判断，为法律NLP提供了无需标注的评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能够生成高度逼真的垃圾评论，对现有检测系统构成严重威胁，损害在线平台可信度。

Method: FraudSquad结合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和图门控变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成数据集上，FraudSquad比最先进基线方法在精确度上提升44.22%，召回率提升43.01%，同时在人类撰写垃圾数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: FraudSquad模型尺寸适中，需要少量标注数据，是应对LLM时代垃圾检测挑战的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题解决中表现出系统性的语法盲点，即使语义简单但表述陌生的题目也会错误应用推理策略，这反映了表面形式与内部表示的脆弱耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学问题解决中存在系统性的语法盲点，当问题表述偏离训练分布时，即使语义简单，模型也会错误应用熟悉的推理策略。

Method: 通过使用正确示例中的语法模板重新表述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度，并基于依存局部性理论(DLT)量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重新表述后的问题往往能得到正确答案，更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中增加的失败率相关。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构错位而非概念难度，语法感知干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTML表格、列表和信息框等半结构化内容在网络上占很大比例，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练。

Result: 在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%。

Conclusion: SCRIBES能够实现可扩展且资源高效的网络信息提取。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Result: 多模态模型在BabyLM基准测试中表现优于之前的基线，但确实在语法相关的纯语言任务中表现不佳。模型融合技术在一定程度上缓解了这个问题，同时保持了多模态性能。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在纯语言基准测试中存在不足，特别是语法任务。模型融合技术是解决这一问题的有效方法，能在保持多模态性能的同时提升纯语言任务表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 在多个模型家族中编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: REPAIR为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演化的LLMs提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning

LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Conclusion: ILM框架为构建更鲁棒、可落地、可控和可信的下一代LLMs提供了基础，代码已公开。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声明验证方法主要依赖提示工程或预设推理流程，缺乏统一的训练范式来提升必要的检索和推理技能。在线声明验证需要迭代的证据检索和推理过程。

Method: 提出Veri-R1在线强化学习框架，让LLM与搜索引擎交互，通过奖励信号明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为。动态交互更准确地反映真实验证场景。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习在精确和可信的声明验证中非常有效，为未来研究奠定了基础。代码已开源以支持社区在LLM赋能声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

TL;DR: 研究探索语言模型能否通过多维度主观标注预测个体价值解释，发现同时提供SEAT四个维度（情感、情绪、论证、主题）能显著提升预测性能，强调考虑个体主观标注行为的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 价值概念的解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，需要开发能够与多样化人类视角对齐的AI系统，避免偏向多数观点。

Method: 使用SEAT维度（情感、情绪、论证、主题）的主观标注作为个体解释视角的代理，在不同零样本和少样本设置下评估语言模型预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或无个体信息的基线表现更优，不同标注者之间存在个体差异，证明考虑个体主观标注行为的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础，尽管样本规模较小但具有开创性意义。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL研究大多在固定模式上评估模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统研究模式规范化程度对NL2SQL性能的影响。

Method: 使用八个领先的大语言模型，在具有不同规范化级别的合成和真实数据集上进行评估。构建了形式化规范化（1NF-3NF）的合成数据集和实际学术论文数据集。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用经济模型在零样本设置下；规范化模式（2NF/3NF）在基础表选择和连接类型预测方面存在挑战，但通过提供少量样本可显著缓解；在聚合查询中，规范化模式表现更好，因其对数据重复和NULL值问题更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于要支持的查询类型，开发NL2SQL接口时应考虑模式设计，并为实际场景集成自适应模式选择。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过系统实验比较了传统基线方法、单语预训练模型和LLM在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交媒体平台虽然具有积极作用，但也成为仇恨言论、攻击性语言和欺凌内容传播的温床。孟加拉语等低资源语言缺乏有效的审核工具，现有研究多为单任务且覆盖范围有限。

Method: 构建了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并系统比较了传统基线方法、单语预训练模型（如BanglaBERT）以及LLM在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的性能。

Result: 实验显示，虽然LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT表现相当，但文化和语言背景的预训练对于稳健性能仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: 该数据集和研究结果为低资源环境下开发文化对齐的审核工具建立了更强基准，强调了文化和语言背景预训练的重要性。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 该研究从过程导向角度评估大语言模型的创造力，引入基于约束的决策作为作者创造力的分析框架，发现LLMs在创作中一致性地优先重视风格元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在通过叙事学视角将LLMs视为计算作者，分析其创作过程中的创造性偏好。

Method: 使用受控提示技术分配作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好，并探究模型选择背后的推理过程。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在创作决策中一致性地将风格置于角色、事件和场景等其他元素之上，不同模型展现出独特的创作偏好特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了新颖的系统性工具，能够揭示不同模型在创作过程中的独特偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，通过在用户说话时并行预测工具查询来降低端到端语音对话系统中的幻觉问题，减少响应延迟20%，提高QA准确率200%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。传统文本对话系统通过集成工具解决此问题，但语音系统中工具集成会增加响应延迟，破坏对话流畅性。

Method: 开发了Streaming RAG框架，包括后训练流程，教导模型在用户说话过程中何时发出工具调用，以及如何生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。构建了AudioCRAG基准数据集进行评估。

Result: Streaming RAG方法将QA准确率从11.1%提升至34.2%（相对提高200%），同时将工具使用延迟降低20%。该方法具有模态无关性，可同等应用于文本输入。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG框架显著提高了语音对话系统的准确性和响应性，为更智能、实时的AI助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

TL;DR: 提出SCoT框架，通过流式思维链方法改进双工对话系统，在保持低延迟和重叠交互的同时，生成更连贯和可解释的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端对话系统依赖语音活动检测进行轮次切换，但无法区分停顿和对话完成。现有双工系统架构复杂且在语义推理上落后于级联模型。

Method: 采用流式思维链框架，交替处理固定时长的用户输入并以分块方式生成响应。利用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标（对齐的用户转录和系统响应）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时支持比逐轮系统更低的延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架成功解决了双工对话系统的架构复杂性和语义推理不足问题，实现了更好的对话质量和交互体验。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推测解码技术在不同任务间加速效果的不均衡现象，特别关注欠拟合和代表性不足任务面临的加速劣势。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码的不公平性，识别导致加速差异的因素，并提出相应的缓解策略。

Result: 验证了缓解策略在多个模型对上的有效性，公平性指标平均提升了12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码存在任务间加速不公平问题，通过针对性策略可以有效缓解这种不公平现象。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: 提出RESTRAIN框架，通过自惩罚机制在无标注数据上实现强化学习，显著提升推理模型的性能，接近有标注训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习成本高昂且在困难任务上表现不佳，需要探索无监督的经验驱动学习方法。

Method: RESTRAIN框架利用模型的整个答案分布信号，惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性样本，同时保留有潜力的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在AIME25上Pass@1提升+140.7%，MMLU_STEM提升+36.2%，GPQA-Diamond提升+19.6%，使用Qwen3-4B-Base和OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base模型，几乎达到有标注训练的效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标注的强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多将幻觉检测视为二元分类任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉片段，这是一个多步骤决策过程。研究显式推理是否有助于检测幻觉片段。

Method: 首先评估带和不带思维链推理的预训练模型，发现CoT推理有潜力生成正确答案。然后提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于组相对策略优化，引入类感知策略优化来解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 使用span级奖励的强化学习对于检测幻觉片段是必要的，RL4HS框架有效提升了幻觉片段检测性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语言对非计算机背景用户具有较高门槛，需要降低知识图谱交互的难度。Text2SPARQL挑战赛推动了该领域的改进需求。

Method: 基于SPINACH代理，采用迭代探索和执行过程进行自然语言到SPARQL的翻译，而非单次转换。

Result: 开发了整体架构并进行了深入的行为分析，为未来针对性改进提供了见解。

Conclusion: LLM支持的迭代方法能够有效降低Text2SPARQL翻译的难度，为知识图谱的可访问性提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自我探索或单一教师模型，容易引入模型偏见并限制探索，影响推理多样性和性能。

Method: AMPO框架采用"按需指导"策略，仅当在策略模型无法生成正确解时，自适应利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，并结合基于理解的路径选择机制。

Conclusion: AMPO提供了一条更高效、可扩展的路径来实现卓越的推理能力和泛化性，使用四个同等规模教师即可达到与使用单个更强大教师相当的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long

LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

TL;DR: 提出Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA)指标和Explore Briefly, Then Decide推理范式，通过Cumulative Entropy Regulation机制动态控制推理深度，有效解决LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上往往过度思考，生成不必要的冗长推理步骤，影响效率且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出Explore Briefly, Then Decide推理范式，结合Cumulative Entropy Regulation机制动态确定最优停止点。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著减轻了过度思考问题，平均响应长度在简单数据集上最多减少71%，同时保持问题解决能力。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了更高效和自适应的推理过程，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，用于评估工具增强型代理在多源信息检索中的表现，发现现有LLM代理在结合通用搜索和领域专用工具方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理过度依赖开放网络搜索，存在内容噪声大、可靠性差的问题，且无法获取精确的领域特定知识。虽然MCP协议允许代理访问数千种专用工具，但代理是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合仍不明确。

Method: 构建InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，涵盖六个代表性领域（医疗、金融、地图、视频、网络和多领域集成），要求代理结合通用搜索和领域专用工具。使用InfoMosaic-Flow流程合成任务，确保任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖关系，并过滤可通过简单查找解决的捷径情况。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM代理的实验显示：(i)仅靠网络信息不足，GPT-5准确率仅38.2%，通过率67.5%；(ii)领域工具提供选择性但不一致的益处，改善某些领域同时降低其他领域；(iii)22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误，表明当前LLM在基本工具处理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在多源信息检索任务中表现不佳，特别是在有效结合通用搜索和领域专用工具方面存在显著挑战，需要进一步改进工具使用能力。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究首次从跨语言角度探讨推理能力的泛化，检验英语RPT获得的推理能力是否能有效转移到其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言可转移性指标，通过干预性研究和全面的平行训练研究分析影响因素。

Result: 发现跨语言可转移性受初始模型、目标语言和训练范式显著影响；提出"首次平行跃迁"现象、"平行缩放定律"和"单语泛化差距"三个关键发现；平行训练能显著提升跨语言推理性能。

Conclusion: 英语中心LRMs未能完全跨语言泛化，挑战了LRM推理模仿人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的LRMs提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM竞技场评估将平局视为模型实力相等而调整评分，但作者质疑这种处理方式，认为平局更可能反映查询难度而非模型实力差异。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，研究忽略平局评分更新对战斗结果预测准确率的影响，并分析平局与查询难度、客观性的关联。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使四种评分系统的战斗结果预测准确率相对提升1-3%，平局更常出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑平局语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Method: 使用半自动数据合成流程生成多样化的运筹学问题-答案对，通过微调Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，并增强模型调用外部求解器的能力。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上，OR-Toolformer达到80.1%的执行准确率，比同规模基线模型高出4.3%以上；在零样本评估中，对两种未见过的运筹学问题类型达到54%的平均准确率，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 工具增强的微调方法能够有效提升LLM在运筹学问题建模和求解中的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不现实假设，要么计算需求过高难以快速适应。日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的认知负载最小化模式（脚本）。

Method: 将日常行为模式建模为计算机代码形式的行为程序，提出ROTE算法：使用LLM合成行为程序假设空间，结合概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE从稀疏观测预测人类和AI行为，在样本内准确率和样本外泛化方面比行为克隆和LLM基线方法提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准在LLM从静态工具向自主智能体转变时变得不足，无法捕捉智能体在交互环境中沟通、说服和协作时出现的社会认知动态。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为受控的"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种挑战性话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 在数百场辩论中发现智能体具有寻求共识的强大倾向，即使没有明确指示也能达到高语义一致性（μ > 0.88）；角色分配能诱导稳定的心理测量特征，特别是认知努力；主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新一代动态、心理测量基础的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Motivation: 现有上下文和记忆基准主要关注对话场景，但企业环境中动态记忆评估的需求对于有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多平台异步事件，模拟现实组织工作流程，采用专家设计和基于代理的合成方法构建数据集。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM和记忆后端在利用长期记忆、处理跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面面临挑战，最佳模型GPT-5仅达到60%正确率。

Conclusion: 该工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的临床决策支持系统，通过分析电子健康记录为处方医生提供治疗建议，采用检索增强生成技术整合结构化和非结构化临床数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂性增加和电子健康记录快速增长为数据驱动的医疗护理带来机遇和挑战，需要辅助工具来增强而非替代临床医生的判断能力。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过分析患者人口统计、症状、诊断和治疗历史等数据生成治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估显示，在适当约束和严格验证下，基于LLM的工具在处方工作流程中可能提供有价值的决策支持，输出具有临床合理性和一致性。

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到真实世界临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性以及与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE是一种检测隐式奖励攻击的方法，通过截断推理链来量化模型努力程度，相比现有监督方法在数学推理和编程任务中分别提升65%和30%的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励攻击问题严重，特别是隐式攻击会绕过现有推理链监控，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出TRACE方法：逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型回答，测量验证器通过率随截断长度的变化，通过准确率-长度曲线下面积来量化模型努力程度。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比72B推理链监控器提升65%以上，在编程任务中比32B监控器提升30%以上，还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE为当前监控方法失效的监督场景提供了可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

### [100] [Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375)
*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的方法，在多个交互基准测试中显著提升LLM智能体性能，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的操作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。虽然检索增强生成(RAG)能通过提供运行时指导来改善性能，但需要维护外部知识库并在每次部署时增加计算开销。

Method: 提出三步管道：(1)从智能体失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示在情节开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的轨迹上训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld(家庭任务)和WebShop(在线购物)两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏后的学生模型始终优于基线智能体：ALFWorld成功率提升至91%(基线79%)，WebShop得分提升至72(基线61)，同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模(7B/14B参数)和智能体架构(ReAct/StateAct)上均能泛化，证明检索优势可以通过针对性微调有效内化，无需永久性的运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM代理自动化数据驱动建模和分析的创新流程，在临界热通量预测任务中表现优异，超越了传统方法并与专家开发的模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程依赖大量实验和模拟数据，传统数据驱动方法需要大量人工干预，难以扩展和泛化到多样化应用。

Method: 评估两种LLM代理框架：多代理协作系统和基于ReAct范式的单代理系统，自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化。

Result: 在约25,000个实验数据点的临界热通量预测基准测试中，LLM代理开发的模型超越了传统查找表，预测精度和不确定性量化与专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个基于大语言模型的自主AI代理，能够将原始系统日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，并通过RAG和迭代校正确保图谱质量，最后将日志证据映射到MITRE ATT&CK战术层面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是重要的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题，其实际效用受到限制。需要能够将噪声异构数据转换为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。系统将知识图谱聚合到会话层面，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够在多个知识图谱后端上稳健生成图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正显著提升了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，基于本体的表示为可操作的网络威胁情报提取提供了重要价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的协作框架，用于可扩展的知识挖掘，在保持高准确性的同时大幅降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高，而传统分类器-提取器流水线又过于脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行流水线，并作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确性上接近最先进LLM，同时减少推理成本达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了高效且可扩展的基础框架，实现了成本效益与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Motivation: 当前AI教育社区往往忽视了领域专家高度策划知识在创建有效辅导系统中的作用，本文旨在强调这一被忽视的话题。

Method: 1. 使用可解释AI技术结合专家指定的问题解决规则来自动生成课程；2. 利用专家指定的学习课程体系来开发自适应辅导系统。

Result: 通过传粉者识别辅导系统的案例研究，证明了这些方法的可行性和重要性。

Conclusion: 高度策划的专家知识在创建新颖教育系统中具有重要作用，能够改善学习体验并提高算法效率。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

*Rui Liu,Dian Yu,Tong Zheng,Runpeng Dai,Zongxia Li,Wenhao Yu,Zhenwen Liang,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Pratap Tokekar,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从输出空间转移到输入空间，将图像视为随机上下文，利用对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样，有效平衡探索与利用，提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态大语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定确定性条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的模糊性，导致策略对合理视觉变化不够鲁棒，探索能力不足。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，生成不确定性感知的探索信号。结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样计划，在GRPO框架中实现。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高pass@4性能并缓解RL微调中常见的探索衰减。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索是改进多模态推理的有效策略，VOGUE方法成功提升了多模态大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在AI法规合规性检测方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试方法。

Method: 通过两步流程创建数据集：(1) 使用结构化指令提示LLM生成120个技术文档样本；(2) 法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了包含120个样本的基准数据集，并评估了前沿LLM在重现专家合规标签方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该数据集为理解基于LLM的AI法规合规评估工具的机遇和局限性提供了起点，并建立了后续LLM比较的基准。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT)方法，通过分离效用和逻辑一致性来解决大型测试时计算预算下的广度饱和和深度短视问题，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算（数千个token或多次节点扩展）用于提升可靠性，但标准思维树搜索存在广度饱和（额外样本产生近重复）和深度短视（噪声短期效用过早修剪分支）的病理问题。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用候选），通过带短路机制的侧向竞赛（LR--SC）进行探索，使用宽度感知阈值和重复确认，并在分支包络超过主线标准时立即提升。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，与未加帽主线的指数增长形成对比，实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: LToT将大型测试时预算转化为原则性多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算的情况下缓解饱和和短视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在大语言模型的数学推理任务中实现高质量推理过程，需要平衡利用已有推理轨迹和探索新路径之间的关系。

Method: 首先训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，然后使用k-means聚类构建token聚类图，基于边权重定义奖励函数来量化推理轨迹的遵循程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够防止极端行为，促进大语言模型中更高质量的推理过程，实现利用与探索之间的平衡权衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保证领域（如法律、医疗）需要准确、可验证且基于证据的推理，但LLM在标准推理任务中的能力无法满足这类严格推理要求，特别是涉及可废止逻辑和例外的情况

Method: 使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长格式指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中，相比四个基线模型，LogT整体性能提升11.84%，在否定推理、蕴含推理和可废止推理三个模式上分别提升最高10.2%、13.2%和5.5%

Conclusion: LogT神经符号架构能有效解决高保证文本指南中的严格推理挑战，显著提升LLM在复杂逻辑推理任务中的表现

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web

*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Xiangchen Song,Xinshuai Dong,Guangyi Chen,Eric P. Xing,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO)算法，通过过程奖励函数引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理路径，解决现有方法中推理步骤无意义的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，可能强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，这与推理的自然结构存在根本性不匹配。

Method: 首先提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，然后引入SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数使扩散语言模型的去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种原则性方法在挑战性推理基准上显著提升性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: SAPO通过将推理过程与模型生成过程对齐，有效解决了扩散语言模型在复杂推理训练中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过先分析潜在危害及其后果，再生成安全回答，显著提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全回答，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性思考。InvThink旨在让模型在生成回答前先分析失败模式，从而更主动地避免风险。

Method: 通过监督微调和强化学习，训练模型执行三个步骤：1) 枚举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。在三个LLM系列上实现。

Result: 相比SafetyPrompt等基线方法，InvThink在有害回答上减少达15.7%；安全性改进随模型规模扩大而增强；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）表现优异；同时保持标准基准上的通用推理能力。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展且泛化性强的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一个协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全机制来保护LLM多智能体系统，无需依赖外部守卫模块，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM多智能体系统防御方法存在局限性：自我验证因单个智能体能力不足而效果不佳，外部守卫模块会增加系统开销并造成单点故障。需要一种既能有效防御越狱攻击和对抗协作，又不会增加系统复杂性的解决方案。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗性学习环境联合优化攻击者（生成进化越狱提示）和防御者（任务智能体），引入基于功能组的公共基线进行优势估计，促进组内协作和稳定学习。

Result: 在各种代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%，同时保持甚至提高了任务准确率（推理任务提升达+3.67%）。

Conclusion: 安全性和实用性可以共同提升，无需依赖额外的守卫智能体或增加系统开销，AdvEvo-MARL为LLM多智能体系统提供了有效的内生安全防御方案。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentRec是一个基于LLM的多智能体协作推荐框架，通过分层智能体网络解决动态用户偏好、对话连贯性和多目标平衡问题，在三个真实数据集上显著提升了对话成功率、推荐准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式对话推荐系统在处理动态用户偏好、保持对话连贯性以及平衡多个排序目标方面面临重大挑战，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层智能体网络架构，包含对话理解、偏好建模、上下文感知和动态排序等专门LLM智能体，通过自适应权重机制协调，结合三层学习策略：简单查询的快速响应、复杂偏好的智能推理和挑战场景的深度协作。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，AgentRec相比最先进基线方法，对话成功率提升2.8%，推荐准确性（NDCG@10）提高1.9%，对话效率提升3.2%，同时通过智能智能体协调保持可比较的计算成本。

Conclusion: AgentRec通过多智能体协作框架有效解决了现有对话推荐系统的关键挑战，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了推荐性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

TL;DR: 本文评估大型语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用潜力，通过PsychoBench基准测试检验LLMs能否通过美国国家咨询师认证考试(NCE)，发现只有前沿模型能达到及格标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估其是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的知识资质。

Method: 构建PsychoBench基准，包含约2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师考试，覆盖心理学各子学科，要求深度理解和广泛知识。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型得分远超及格线（约70%），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于及格标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这既显示了心理学导向LLMs的发展前景，也凸显了相关挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的上下文马尔可夫决策过程(CMDPs)方法，使用大语言模型(LLMs)压缩高维上下文输入为低维语义摘要，提升决策效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算开销大、性能不稳定，需要一种能有效压缩上下文信息的方法。

Method: 利用LLMs进行信息论摘要，将上下文输入压缩为低维语义丰富的摘要，这些摘要通过保留决策关键信息同时减少冗余来增强状态表示。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率、样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: LLM-based摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否具备理解道路网络地图并进行导航的能力，探索其在真实世界地理空间任务中的潜力。

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，构建包含4000+真实轨迹的GLOBALTRACE数据集，使用道路网络作为上下文，通过提示框架让LLM生成路径。

Result: LLM在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专门模型，具有强大的零样本泛化能力，但对不同区域和交通方式存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM具备强大的道路网络和坐标系理解能力，能够通过灵活的地图推理来增强导航体验，但需要解决区域和交通方式的偏差问题。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了计算机使用代理(CUAs)存在盲目的目标导向性(BGD)风险，即不顾可行性、安全性和上下文而盲目追求目标的行为模式，并开发了BLIND-ACT基准来评估和量化这种风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但现有研究缺乏对这些代理在目标不可行、不安全或不合理情况下行为模式的系统性分析。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准，包含90个任务捕捉BGD的三种模式：缺乏上下文推理、在模糊性下做出假设和决策、追求矛盾或不可行的目标。基于OSWorld构建真实环境，使用基于LLM的评估器评估代理行为。

Result: 评估了9个前沿模型，包括Claude Sonnet和Opus 4、Computer-Use-Preview、GPT-5，观察到平均BGD率高达80.8%。基于提示的干预措施能降低BGD水平，但风险仍然存在。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和减轻这种基本风险、确保CUA安全部署奠定了基础，揭示了即使输入没有直接危害时也会出现的微妙风险。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Result: E5-large-instruct编码器在测试集上达到0.983的准确率，AUC 0.996，仅7个错误，与GPT-4o表现相当，非生成临床路径能耗仅为本地8B SLM的1/170。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过验证的FAQ逐字答案，在临床路径中结构性地避免了前沿判别和生成引起的错误，支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法依赖对智能的直觉理解来设计合成任务，这在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于数据科学实践的替代设计哲学，专注于评估稳健任务执行能力，通过实际部署能力来展示AGI。

Result: 提供了AGI评估的实际示例，展示了如何通过稳健任务执行来证明AGI能力。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向基于能力的评估方法，通过展示系统在真实环境中的可靠部署来证明AGI，而非依赖直觉设计的合成任务。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要一种能够产生与接受响应风格和长度相似的拒绝响应的方法。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑开发硬负响应生成框架，创建VaPR数据集，对LLaVA、Qwen2VL和Qwen2.5VL等LVLM进行微调。

Result: 在十个基准测试中平均提升6.5%(LLaVA)、4.0%(Qwen2VL)和1.5%(Qwen2.5VL)，推理任务表现显著改善，减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好标注的噪声问题，性能随数据规模扩展而提升，且可泛化到开源LLM作为编辑器。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Motivation: 解决代谢组学知识图谱使用中的技术障碍，传统方法需要用户深入了解图谱本体和查询语言语法，限制了非技术用户的使用。

Method: 采用多代理系统架构，包括入口代理、验证代理、监督代理、知识图谱代理和查询生成代理，使用LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功弥合了复杂语义技术与用户友好交互之间的差距，使研究人员能够通过自然语言查询访问结构化的代谢组学数据。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Motivation: 解决理论AI构建与操作网络安全需求之间的差距，提供透明且逐步的方法来选择AI解决方案应对当代网络威胁。

Method: 将NIST CSF 2.0功能分解为具体任务，将AI智能体特性（自主性、自适应学习、实时响应）与每个子类别的安全要求相关联，并定义分级自主性水平。

Result: 通过概念验证表明，定制化的AI智能体部署能够与现实约束和风险状况对齐，增强态势感知、加速响应时间并通过自适应风险管理加强长期韧性。

Conclusion: 该研究在理论AI构建与操作网络安全需求之间建立了桥梁，为遵循行业标准的稳健、经验验证的多智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Motivation: 在快速演变的军事威胁和复杂作战环境中，AI集成面临有效性和伦理挑战，需要从系统内部动态角度处理多维责任、安全和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 设计包含四个维度的协同学习模型：可调节自主性、多层控制、双向反馈和协作决策，支持人机双向洞察交流。

Conclusion: 该模型通过四个维度的整合，为军事行动中构建可信赖的人机协作系统提供了有效框架。

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入感知指导的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中依赖思维链推理，但由于自回归的token级生成，推理过程局限于局部决策而缺乏全局规划，导致冗余、不连贯或不准确的推理，严重影响性能。现有方法如树算法和强化学习计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: PTA-GRPO两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑高层指导进行监督微调；2) 引入感知指导的强化学习方法，联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上的实验表明，PTA-GRPO在不同模型和任务上均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力，验证了其有效性和泛化性，通过结合高层规划和细粒度推理优化，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 该论文将对抗性逆强化学习应用于大语言模型推理，学习密集的token级奖励模型用于过程监督，而非通过监督微调模仿风格。该推理奖励既能在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，也能在推理时作为评判者重新排序采样轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作化对抗性逆强化学习到大型语言模型推理中，直接从专家演示中学习密集的token级奖励模型，而不是通过监督微调模仿风格。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法学习密集的推理奖励模型，该模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为评判者重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络，证明了：(i)密集推理奖励可以作为学习信号引发推理；(ii)通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时间选择和token级诊断统一到单个推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

TL;DR: 提出了CARS方法，在保持语言模型分布不变的前提下，通过自适应剪枝技术提高约束生成的采样效率，解决了现有方法在有效性和多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样则计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等需要同时保证有效性和多样性的领域，这两种方法都有问题。

Method: CARS从无约束采样开始，通过记录违反约束的连续序列到trie结构中，并从未来采样中减去这些序列的概率质量，实现自适应剪枝。确保已证明无效的前缀不会被重新访问。

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的LM前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CARS严格改进了拒绝采样的样本效率而不产生分布扭曲，能够生成严格遵循约束分布的样本，同时接受率单调提高。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 该研究评估大语言模型在集体决策中与人类社会推理的对齐程度，通过Lost at Sea实验发现不同LLM在模拟人类群体行为时表现出不同的偏差模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，现有研究主要关注个体层面，缺乏集体层面的评估。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配群体进行领导者选举，比较可见人口属性与匿名化名的差异，然后模拟匹配的LLM群体。

Result: 不同LLM行为存在分歧：有些镜像人类偏见，有些掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个确定性模拟框架，为评估AI生成的同行评审报告提供稳定、基于证据的标准，能够模拟校准的编辑判断并保持程序完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临提交量过大和AI不受监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学完整性。传统的人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准。

Method: 采用确定性模拟框架分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标来评估AI生成的同行评审报告。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决定在所有学科中始终占多数（>50%），'拒绝'率在健康科学领域动态适应至45%；保持29%的证据锚定合规率，在不同评审任务和科学领域中保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的审计工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准缺乏文本语义上下文，忽略了特征描述和领域知识等关键信息，限制了模型充分利用领域知识进行检测的能力。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了经典、深度学习和基于LLM的异常检测算法；提出了零样本LLM框架，无需任务特定训练即可利用语义上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明，语义上下文提高了检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Motivation: 反驳先前研究中"深层对表示学习贡献有限"的片面结论，指出这些结论基于狭窄评估，可能忽略模型行为的重要方面。

Method: 在不同维度（评估协议、任务类别、模型架构）上系统研究深度利用率，包括基于似然和生成的评估，以及层剪枝分析。

Result: 证实深层通常不如浅层有效，但其贡献因评估设置而异：基于似然的评估中大部分层可剪枝，而生成评估显示中深层对推理和长程连贯性不可或缺。知识和检索集中在浅层，推理精度严重依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑。

Conclusion: LLM中的深度使用高度异质化和上下文依赖，强调在解释和压缩大模型时需要任务、指标和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，虽然AI模型在文本形式的ConceptARC任务中能达到人类水平的准确率，但其抽象推理能力被高估，因为模型往往依赖表面模式而非真正的抽象概念。在视觉形式下，模型准确率下降但可能被低估，因为它们确实能识别抽象概念但应用能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估AI模型是否真正理解ARC-AGI基准测试中设计的抽象概念，而不仅仅是依赖表面模式获得高准确率。

Method: 在ConceptARC任务上评估模型，改变输入形式（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理努力程度，并通过分析模型生成的自然语言规则来评估其抽象推理能力。

Result: 文本形式下，模型准确率接近人类但规则分析显示其依赖表面捷径；视觉形式下，模型准确率下降但规则分析显示其确实能识别抽象概念，只是应用能力不足。

Conclusion: 仅凭准确率评估抽象推理能力会高估文本形式下的能力而低估视觉形式下的能力，需要结合规则分析来更准确地评估模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大规模、多样化的标注数据，但传统方法收集成本高昂，受隐私和法律限制影响。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，FlexDoc生成的数据将F1分数绝对提升高达11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速企业级文档理解模型的开发，显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

TL;DR: UpSafe°C是一个通过安全感知升级增强LLM安全性的统一框架，采用稀疏MoE结构和安全温度机制，在保持通用能力的同时提供动态安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时指导和后训练对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限性，需要更灵活的安全增强方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C实现了对有害和越狱输入的稳健安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度机制实现了效用与安全性的帕累托最优前沿。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM安全指明了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)在提升大语言模型推理能力时，反而会缩小推理边界。论文揭示了负干扰和赢家通吃两个关键现象，并提出针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法来改善Pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR被广泛用于提升大语言模型的推理能力，但近期证据表明它可能反而会缩小推理边界而非扩展。本文旨在研究RLVR的收缩问题及其学习动态。

Method: 通过理论分析和在多个数学推理基准上的实证研究，揭示了RLVR中的负干扰现象和赢家通吃现象，并提出了一种专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 研究发现RLVR会导致负干扰（学习解决某些问题会降低其他问题正确解的概率）和赢家通吃现象（过度强化高概率问题而抑制低概率问题），提出的数据筛选算法显著提升了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的收缩问题源于标准强化学习目标中的固有策略采样，导致模型收敛到狭窄的解决策略。专注于低概率问题的数据筛选是改善这一问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

### [139] [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Agents for Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02250)
*Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Vincent Tu,Chih-Lun Lee,Jiachen Yang,Ang Li,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN)方法，通过生成多个rollout并使用行为叙事进行选择，显著提高了计算机使用代理的可靠性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理(CUAs)在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个rollout并使用描述代理行为的行为叙事来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的最新SOTA性能，显著优于先前方法，接近72%的人类水平性能，在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 当正确实施时，扩展CUAs具有不合理的有效性，有效扩展需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

*Yuxiao Qu,Anikait Singh,Yoonho Lee,Amrith Setlur,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Chelsea Finn,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RLAD方法，通过推理抽象来引导模型学习有效的推理过程，包含抽象生成器和解决方案生成器的两玩家RL训练范式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型模型在推理过程中往往无法一致地捕获或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够针对问题提出多个抽象描述，然后使用RL激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案，形成两玩家RL训练范式

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能够有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有益于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物信号模态间存在相关性，但大标注数据集稀缺，传统知识蒸馏方法计算开销大，特别是面对大型基础模型时效率低下。

Method: 训练轻量级桥接网络对齐基础模型的中间表示，实现跨模态信息流动，包含高效的桥接位置选择策略和灵活的原型网络架构。

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge为生物信号跨模态知识迁移提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于大型基础模型场景，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
