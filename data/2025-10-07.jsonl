Although it is intuitive to\nintegrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that\nalign the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To\nthis end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of\nTSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate\ndiverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment\ntraining. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction\nfinetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an\nLLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it\nduring training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that\nTS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with\nremarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data."}

At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities\nfrom the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the\noutput probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for\nmodern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:\ninstruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM\nstate pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDeco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including\nmathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction. Overall,\nour approach yields 1.0% to 6.0% relative gain over regular prompting practice\nwith guaranteed format compliance."}

One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more\naccurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as\nensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking\nat ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical\nframework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to\n\"abstain\" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of\nthe threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of\nthe remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as\nwell as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem\nsolving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that\nlarge gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive\nvoting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response\nyield and accuracy.

These insights underline the limitations of LLMs in metaphor\nanalysis and call for more robust computational approaches."}

As AI\nsystems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,\nthe concept of a \"perfect mimic\"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a\nhuman through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to\ntechnologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating\ndilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness\nto others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning.

Notably, first-order ToM\n(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than\nsecond-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight\nthat for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a\npartner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude\nthat prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the\ncollaborative capabilities of future models."}

To address this limitation, we propose\na peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG.\n  Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics\nsuch as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research\nand risk."}

This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.

We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data.

We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool.

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under\nconstrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,\nwith larger gains as budgets tighten."}

Although they do not achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific\ntasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a\nsystem where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any\nindividual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and\nGSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical\nanalyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we\ndemonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and\nefficient systems through the proposed approach."}

A major issue is the lack\nof access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual\nstudents. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of\nprompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language\nis inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM\noptimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of\nstate-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000\nhours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by\nPolygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.\nWe use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model\nthat enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.\nBuilding on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol\nthat leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and\nreproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our\nevaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data\nsignificantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling\nstudent talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by\n50%, and greater personalization of instruction."}

Work in progress", "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising\nalternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as\naccelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the\nvanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:\nonce a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a\nresult, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate\npredictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose\nTolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding\nstrategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike\nexisting methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure,\nTolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii)\niterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while\ntreating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted\ntokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more\nreliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard\nbenchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.\nExperiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the\nbaselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that\ndecoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion\nlarge language models. Code and data are publicly available."}
