### [1] [Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models for Persian in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12807)
*Mahdi Cherakhloo,Arash Abbasi,Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz,Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对多个开源大语言模型在波斯语NLP任务上的综合基准测试，发现Gemma 2在零样本和少样本学习中都表现最佳，但在命名实体识别等任务上仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多语言任务上表现出色，但在波斯语等低资源语言上的有效性需要系统评估，以填补现有研究空白。

Method: 使用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解等任务上，采用零样本和少样本学习范式，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标进行评估。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式中都表现最优，尤其在复杂推理任务上优势明显，但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言大语言模型在波斯语上的性能提供了重要基准，揭示了模型在波斯语处理中的特定挑战，为未来模型开发提供了参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

### [2] [Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12813)
*Soheil Hashtarkhani,Rezaur Rashid,Christopher L Brett,Lokesh Chinthala,Fekede Asefa Kumsa,Janet A Zink,Robert L Davis,David L Schwartz,Arash Shaban-Nejad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估4个大语言模型和BioBERT在从结构化与非结构化电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能，BioBERT在ICD代码分类表现最佳，GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类中领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动化诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 分析762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）来自3456名癌症患者记录。测试模型将诊断分类到14个预定义类别，由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o持平（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前性能水平足以用于行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及针对高风险决策的强大人工监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

### [3] [From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12817)
*Shanshan Xu,Santosh T. Y. S. S,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应将人类标签变异（HLV）作为自目的来保留，而不是将其视为噪声。作者呼吁在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV，以体现人类价值观的多元性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集通常将多个标注聚合成单一标签，抹杀了人类视角的多样性，而这正是AI对齐旨在保留的人类价值观多元性。

Method: 提出在偏好数据集中主动保留HLV的具体可行步骤，将HLV视为体现人类多元性的信号而非噪声。

Result: 通过保留HLV，可以更好地反映人类价值观的多样性，避免将多元视角错误地统一为虚假的普遍共识。

Conclusion: HLV应被视为自目的，在AI系统设计中主动保留人类视角的多样性，这对于实现真正的人类价值观对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

### [4] [MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12818)
*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个反事实基准，通过仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）来评估大型语言模型在临床决策中的推理稳定性，发现虽然整体相似性高，但在风险因素、指南引用和鉴别诊断排序方面存在局部差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床决策支持中部署越来越多，但人口统计学线索可能影响其推理。虽然已有研究记录了不同患者群体间的输出差异，但对受控人口统计学变化下内部推理如何变化了解甚少。

Method: 引入MEDEQUALQA基准，仅改变患者代词而保持关键症状和条件不变，每个临床案例扩展为单症状消融，产生三个平行数据集（共约69,000项）。评估GPT-4.1模型，使用语义文本相似性（STS）测量推理轨迹的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示整体相似性高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用的风险因素、指南锚点和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。错误分析突显了某些推理发生变化的案例。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医学AI中的推理稳定性提供了受控诊断环境，揭示了可能级联导致不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

### [5] [Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12825)
*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具配置复杂耗时，需要专业知识，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程

Method: 采用分类器增强生成方法，结合话语分解、分类器和阶段特定few-shot提示，预测阶段并连接成非线性工作流，推断阶段属性

Result: 相比基线方法，在准确性和效率方面表现更好，同时显著减少token使用量

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动的ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释性特点

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

### [6] [Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12826)
*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了前沿LLM代理在博弈论框架下的策略性欺骗能力，发现即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其策略性欺骗能力变得至关重要，而LLM之间的欺骗行为研究尚不充分。

Method: 使用两种博弈论框架：廉价信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈，测试了四种前沿LLM模型，通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 当被提示时，大多数模型（特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）达到接近完美的表现。未提示时，所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），在廉价信号博弈中成功率达到95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行鲁棒评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

### [7] [Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12829)
*Hieu Le Duc,Leo Liberti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT使用多实例协作协议成功解决了5个2025年IMO问题和22个数论猜想，并通过Lean证明助手和人工验证确保证明正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是在解决国际数学奥林匹克竞赛问题和数论猜想方面的表现。

Method: 采用多个gpt-5模型实例协作的协议，包括证明者和验证者角色，最终使用Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工检查前提和结论的一致性。

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO 6个问题中的5个，以及Cohen数论猜想中66个中的22个（约三分之一）。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了大型语言模型在定理证明方面的潜力，通过协作协议和形式化验证可以有效减少幻觉问题，实现可靠的数学证明。

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

### [8] [MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831)
*Taicheng Guo,Hai Wang,ChaoChun Liu,Mohsen Golalikhani,Xin Chen,Xiangliang Zhang,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个用于多轮Text-to-SQL的智能体训练框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程将任务建模为执行-验证-精炼的迭代循环，显著提升了查询的可执行性和对话连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL简单视为文本翻译任务，采用短视范式生成查询而不执行、验证和精炼，导致输出不可执行或不连贯。

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，智能体与数据库（执行反馈）和持久对话记忆（连贯性验证）交互，执行迭代的提出-执行->验证->精炼循环，直到所有检查通过。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1始终优于强基线，突显了环境驱动验证和记忆引导精炼在对话语义解析中的重要性。

Conclusion: MTSQL-R1框架通过执行反馈和连贯性验证的迭代精炼过程，有效解决了多轮Text-to-SQL中的可执行性和连贯性问题，为社区研究提供了完整解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

### [9] [Repurposing Annotation Guidelines to Instruct LLM Annotators: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12835)
*Kon Woo Kim,Rezarta Islamaj,Jin-Dong Kim,Florian Boudin,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨如何将现有标注指南重新用于指导大语言模型进行文本标注任务，提出了一种基于LLM调节的指南重构方法，并在NCBI疾病语料库上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为人类标注者设计的，而大语言模型需要明确的结构化指令，因此需要研究如何将现有指南重新用于指导LLM标注。

Method: 提出基于LLM调节的指南重构方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统指南转化为适合LLM的明确指令。

Result: 实验表明重构后的指南能有效指导LLM标注者，同时揭示了一些实际挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持可扩展、成本效益高的标注指南优化和自动化标注的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

*Qianben Chen,Jingyi Cao,Jiayu Zhang,Tianrui Qin,Xiaowan Li,King Zhu,Dingfeng Shi,He Zhu,Minghao Liu,Xiaobo Liang,Ge Zhang,Jian Yang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型A²FM，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM和代理型LLM之间的能力割裂问题，避免在简单查询上过度推理或过度调用工具导致的效率低下。

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式处理简单查询；提出自适应策略优化(APO)进行多模式自适应采样。

Result: 在32B规模上，A²FM在BrowseComp、AIME25和HLE上分别达到13.4%、70.4%和16.7%，创下可比模型中的新SOTA；自适应执行每个正确答案成本仅$0.00487，相比推理型和代理型分别降低成本45.2%和33.5%。

Conclusion: A²FM统一框架在保持准确性的同时显著提升了成本效率，为LLM的推理和工具使用能力提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了FastFact框架，通过分块级声明提取和基于置信度的预验证，结合文档级证据收集，高效评估长文本LLM生成的事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLM长文本生成事实性存在效率低和效果差的问题，包括复杂流水线不适合长文本、声明集不准确和证据收集不足。

Method: 使用分块级声明提取与置信度预验证减少搜索成本，收集文档级证据并在验证时选择性检索，解决证据不足问题。

Result: 在聚合的人工标注基准上实验表明，FastFact在效率和效果上都优于现有基线，与人工评估对齐度最高。

Conclusion: FastFact框架能高效可靠地评估长文本LLM生成的事实性，解决了现有方法的效率和效果问题。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

*Jesse Atuhurra,Iqra Ali,Tomoya Iwakura,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Tatsuya Hiraoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个多语言基准VLURes，用于评估视觉语言模型在英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含八个任务和一个创新的无关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语基准，且多为短文本。需要评估VLMs在多语言、长文本设置下的细粒度能力，特别是针对低资源语言。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中构建数据集，涵盖十个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文。通过提示VLMs生成响应和推理，进行自动评估和母语者人工评估。

Result: 评估了十个VLMs，表现最佳的GPT-4o模型总体准确率为90.8%，比人类表现低6.7%。开源模型与人类表现的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准在开发智能代理处理多模态视觉推理方面发挥关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

### [13] [Efficient Adaptive Transformer: An Empirical Study and Reproducible Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12856)
*Jan Miller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EAT框架将三种自适应效率技术（渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力、动态早退）统一到单一可复现架构中，提供开源基准测试流水线，在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能增加延迟，但在SST-2上比优化后的DistilBERT基线精度略高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个统一的自适应推理框架，将多种效率技术整合到单一架构中，为社区提供可复现的研究工具。

Method: 提出EAT框架，统一渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态早退三种自适应效率技术，并提供开源基准测试流水线，在GLUE任务上进行自动化数据处理、计时和消融实验。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中，组合这些机制可能增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上比优化后的DistilBERT基线精度略高，展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力。

Conclusion: EAT的主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，包含脚本、CSV日志和分析工具，旨在作为社区工具推动自适应transformer的进一步研究。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文批判现有基于自动语音识别(ASR)的古兰经诵读评估工具，提出向基于知识的计算框架转变，强调应基于规范的发音规则而非统计模式来构建评估系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字技术虽提供教育机会，但现有的古兰经诵读自动评估工具未能实现广泛应用和教学效果，存在数据依赖、人口偏见等问题。

Method: 通过对过去20年学术研究、网络平台和商业应用的全面分析，批判数据驱动范式，提出知识中心计算框架，基于规范的发音规则和发音点进行预期声学建模。

Result: 分析发现现有方法存在根本性错位，ASR架构优先词汇识别而非定性声学评估，无法提供有诊断价值的反馈。

Conclusion: 古兰经自动评估的未来在于将深度语言知识与先进音频分析相结合的混合系统，以开发稳健、公平且教学合理的工具。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Zhongxiang Dai,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduDial，一个全面的多轮师生对话数据集，涵盖345个核心知识点和34,250个对话会话，基于Bloom教育目标分类学和十种提问策略构建，并开发了EduDial-LLM 32B模型，在11维评估框架下显著优于17个主流LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育领域的应用日益重要，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力，现有的多轮对话基准不足以满足教育场景的需求。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，基于Bloom教育目标分类学和十种提问策略生成对话，设计针对不同认知水平学生的差异化教学策略，训练EduDial-LLM 32B模型，并建立11维评估框架。

Result: 实验显示大多数主流LLM在以学生为中心的教学场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial为教育领域的LLM评估提供了重要基准，EduDial-LLM展示了在师生对话场景中的优越性能，推动了智能教育的发展。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

*Nil-Jana Akpinar,Chia-Jung Lee,Vanessa Murdock,Pietro Perona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了LLMs对询问角色的鲁棒性，发现用户提供的身份、专业背景等个人信息会显著影响问答准确性，并引发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs应该基于客观知识真实回答事实性问题，而不受用户个人背景信息的影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见询问角色的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 通过评估LLMs对询问角色（如身份、专业背景、信仰等用户属性）的响应，测试模型在人类中心化询问情境下的表现。

Result: 询问角色提示会显著改变问答准确性，并触发多种故障模式：拒绝回答、产生幻觉限制、角色混淆等。

Conclusion: 模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性，询问角色测试是评估LLM鲁棒性的有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

*Angana Borah,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CUEST框架来评估LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现，发现LLMs在好奇心表达上偏向西方文化，并通过微调策略缩小了50%的人机对齐差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在人类互动中的作用不断扩大，但好奇心这一核心驱动力在不同文化背景下的表现尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，引入CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机好奇心对齐度。

Result: 发现LLMs会削弱跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLMs的跨文化适应性具有实际价值，对未来的NLP研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过引入中间限定模型来桥接草稿模型和目标模型之间的分布差距，允许使用更小的草稿模型，提高接受率和生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在草稿模型大小和令牌接受率之间存在权衡：较小的草稿模型生成更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果减弱。

Method: 在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入中间限定模型，采用分层解码策略和模糊接受标准来改善模型间的对齐。

Result: PyramidSD 相比标准推测解码实现了最高1.91倍的生成速度，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒，在内存受限环境下仅以最小质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD 提供了一种实用的方法来提高推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模实证评估LLM生成针对特定人口特征个性化虚假信息的能力，发现简单的个性化提示策略显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，并改变语言模式增强虚假信息说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究表明LLM能生成虚假信息，但关于其生成针对特定人口特征的个性化虚假信息的说服力和个性化程度问题尚未充分研究，需要评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用红队方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性，创建AI-TRAITS数据集（包含约160万条文本），基于324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物档案，覆盖4种主要语言和关键人口统计维度。

Result: 个性化提示显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，改变语言和修辞模式，并增强LLM生成虚假信息的说服力。

Conclusion: 当前最先进LLM存在严重漏洞，个性化策略会绕过安全机制，需要改进多语言和跨人口统计背景下的安全对齐和检测策略。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，保护预训练知识的关键奇异方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大语言模型时存在灾难性遗忘问题，学习更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用正交投影P_L = I - U_k U_k^⊤和P_R = I - V_k V_k^⊤约束LoRA更新完全位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 实验证明OPLoRA在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务中显著减少遗忘，同时在LLaMA-2 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上保持竞争力的任务特定性能。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保护的有效机制，数学上保证前k个奇异三元组的精确保留。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏基于人类发展轨迹的持续学习评估基准，需要系统评估模型在逐步获取新技能方面的能力，特别是技能保留和迁移效率。

Method: 构建了技能图谱将广泛技能分解为小能力、具体目标和可测量指标，生成包含段落、理解问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对的合成数据集，使用1.35亿参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序训练设置下进行实验。

Result: 展示了技能保留和迁移效率之间的权衡，支持对遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移的精确分析。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差(PVar)对直接偏好优化(DPO)训练效果的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地进行模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差衡量模型在比较回答对时的偏好差异程度，可能影响DPO训练效果。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受PVar控制。使用奖励模型生成偏好数据，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上微调LLMs，比较不同PVar水平的提示效果。

Result: 实验表明高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示。使用较小奖励模型(1B, 3B)进行选择时，PVar方法依然稳健。在UltraFeedback数据集上，仅使用PVar最高的10%提示训练比使用完整数据集效果更好。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以进行高效LLM对齐的重要指标，高PVar提示能显著提升DPO训练效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需参数的方法，通过识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，直接提升MoE模型中专家选择的多样性，避免功能冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型使用MoE架构进行高效扩展，但面临关键挑战：功能相似的专家经常同时被选择，导致冗余计算并限制有效模型容量。现有的辅助平衡损失方法改善了token分布，但未能解决根本的专家多样性问题。

Method: 提出GatePro方法，识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家同时激活，同时保持自然的专家专业化。该方法无需额外可学习参数，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署。

Result: 综合评估显示GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效。分析表明GatePro能够实现增强的专家多样性，专家发展出更独特和互补的能力，避免功能冗余。

Conclusion: GatePro为提升MoE模型效果提供了实用解决方案，通过直接促进专家选择多样性来优化模型性能。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的不确定性量化对于提高模型可靠性至关重要，但现有方法存在挑战。

Method: 从因果视角建立LLM不确定性与语义保持干预下不变性的联系，提出灰盒不确定性量化方法，测量语义保持干预前后模型输出的变化。

Result: 在多种LLM和问答数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 临床试验对于医学进步至关重要，但需要包含具有适当和多样化医疗背景的参与者。传统方法效率低下，需要自动化系统来改进临床试验资格评估。

Method: 结合Word2Vec词嵌入、命名实体识别、计数向量化和TF-IDF等特征提取方法，使用加权TF-IDF词嵌入整合计数和嵌入方法的优势，应用随机森林和SVM进行多标签分类，评估TextRank、Luhn和GPT-3等摘要技术。

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 当前LLM的一次性预测准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究这两个因素对集成性能的影响。

Method: 比较两种一次性策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时变化采样温度参数来调节输出多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升+7.6%，RMSE降低-10.5%；并且超过5-shot提示：宏F1提升+21.1%，RMSE降低-24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择和增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效一次性LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前AI评估中代表性不足，需要专门的基准来评估LLMs与该地区文化价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中性、个性化、文化观察者）和两种语言模式（英语、本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现三个关键现象：跨语言价值偏移、推理诱导退化、对数概率泄漏，以及模型在本地语言中将多样化国家视为单一实体的问题。

Conclusion: MENAValues提供了一个可扩展的文化错位诊断框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供了实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

TL;DR: Mirror-SD是一种推理算法，通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理，打破推测解码中的延迟-接受率权衡，实现高接受率和低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在增加草稿大小时会提高接受率但引入额外延迟，现有方法无法同时优化延迟和接受率。

Method: 使用分支完整展开与目标模型并行执行，在异构加速器上映射计算，并采用推测流式处理让草稿每步生成多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上，14B到66B参数模型上实现2.8x-5.8x端到端加速，相比最强基线EAGLE3平均提升30%。

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和推测流式处理，将推测解码推向高接受率低开销的理想状态。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

*Nyx Iskandar,Hisham Bedri,Andy Tsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出并评估了用于图结构抽象代码生成的JSON表示方法，证明了LLMs能够通过合适的图表示实现高精度的图结构代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型擅长生成原始顺序代码，但在图结构抽象代码生成方面研究不足，这在视觉编程语言和无法访问源代码的场景中很重要。

Method: 提出并评估了图结构的JSON表示方法，在基于Scratch的Python重新实现的ScratchTest基准上进行测试。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能够在单次生成中完成图结构代码生成任务，不同表示方法会显著影响生成准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图结构抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，证明了图表示在此类生成任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

TL;DR: CoT-Evo：一种进化式思维链蒸馏框架，通过构建多样化的推理轨迹池，结合领域知识检索，并运用基于新颖性选择、反思性重组和突变的迭代优化方法，生成高质量的科学推理训练数据，从而提升小型模型在科学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链蒸馏在科学领域效果有限，因为即使是先进的大语言模型也常产生错误或肤浅的推理。直接蒸馏这些有缺陷的输出会导致训练数据质量低下，限制学生模型的性能。

Method: 构建多样化推理轨迹池，自动检索领域知识进行丰富，通过基于新颖性选择、反思性重组和突变的迭代优化方法，使用评估答案正确性、连贯性和知识利用效率的适应度函数指导优化过程。

Result: 生成高质量的科学推理思维链数据集，使用该数据集微调的紧凑模型在科学推理基准测试中达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CoT-Evo建立了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化和易出错的大语言模型中合成高保真度的科学推理数据。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于思维链微调的调查主要关注技术层面，缺乏从人类推理机制角度的系统分析。鉴于CoT微调的最终目标是让大语言模型像人类一样推理，从人类认知角度研究这一技术至关重要。

Method: 受著名的六顶思考帽框架启发，该框架使用六种隐喻帽子系统描述常见的人类思维模式，作者通过这一视角对CoT微调方法进行分类和检验。

Result: 编制了现有数据集和模型性能的全面概述，并维护了一个实时GitHub仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Conclusion: 这项调查有望成为有价值的资源，激发创新并促进这个快速发展领域的进步。

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码在不进行参数微调的情况下实现大语言模型去毒，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法都基于外部约束，需要额外资源开销且会损失生成流畅性

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成过程中加强安全层的内部下一个token分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面都达到了SOTA性能

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量级、高兼容性和即插即用能力，可作为实用且可扩展的LLM安全部署解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLM中的对抗性攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过对抗性输入在良性提示中隐藏有害目标。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，通过明确的操作（阻止、重构、转发）来构建定制化的安全提示，实现细粒度的拒绝或安全重定向。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLM上，SHIELD持续降低了越狱和不遵循率，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLM，具有可忽略的开销且易于扩展到新的攻击类型。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在检索增强生成(RAG)中，检索文档的格式框架（如分隔符、结构标记等）会显著影响模型性能，即使语义内容相同。作者提出了上下文归一化策略来标准化上下文表示，提高RAG的鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，而检索文档的格式框架（上下文格式）的影响尚未充分探索。作者发现即使是表面上的格式选择也会导致准确性和稳定性的显著变化。

Method: 设计了控制实验来研究上下文密度、分隔符样式和位置放置的影响，并提出了上下文归一化策略，在生成前自适应地标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实世界RAG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提策略能持续提高对顺序变化的鲁棒性，并增强长上下文利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅依赖于检索正确的内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式。该研究提供了新的实证证据和实用技术，以改善长上下文推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 传统语音翻译系统忽略韵律特征，特别是词级重音，导致翻译结果缺乏情感和意图表达。

Method: 利用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，将源语言重音转换为目标语言标签，指导可控TTS模型生成带重音的翻译语音。

Result: 实验显示该方法在保留重音方面显著优于基线，同时保持可比的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中保留副语言线索提供了有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练大语言模型嵌入的两步文本异常检测方法面临高维密集嵌入带来的内存需求大和计算时间长的问题。

Method: 引入简化隔离核(SIK)，通过创新的边界聚焦特征映射，将高维密集嵌入转换为低维稀疏表示，同时保留关键异常特征。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法有效解决了高维嵌入带来的计算和内存挑战，在文本异常检测中实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法，使用大语言模型为代表性不足群体生成反事实示例，在保持标签完整性的同时减少AI系统的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统中的偏见问题，特别是在依赖自然语言数据的系统中，引发了伦理和实践担忧。传统公平性方法依赖受保护属性标签，涉及准确性与公平性的权衡，且难以跨数据集泛化。

Method: 使用大语言模型生成性别交换的释义，通过结构化提示创建反事实示例，并进行语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查等质量控制。

Result: LGSA方法将性别偏见差距从7.2%降低到1.9%，同时将准确率从96.7%提升到99.1%，改善了女性标签示例的性能表现。

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子组平衡。

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

Motivation: 研究LLM是否具有类似人类大脑的句法处理机制，以及其行为能力的计算基础。

Method: 使用HFTP工具进行频域分析，识别LLM神经元和大脑皮层区域中的句法结构编码，并进行表征相似性分析。

Result: 发现LLM在相似层处理句法，而人脑在不同皮层区域处理不同句法层次；LLM表征与大脑左半球更相似；模型升级后与大脑相似性趋势不同。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，为理解LLM行为改进的机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在许多基准测试中表现出色，但在需要抽象推理的任务上仍有根本性弱点，特别是当任务涉及与LLM训练数据不同的表示形式时。

Method: 引入Concept棋盘游戏作为基准，评估LLM在自然语言表示中的溯因推理能力，并在多种语言中测试模型性能。

Result: 人类在此游戏中成功率超过90%，而最先进的LLM成功率不超过40%。LLM在解释其他玩家的战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正初始假设方面存在困难，且在低资源语言中表现更差。

Conclusion: Concept游戏是一个有效的基准，揭示了LLM在自然语言溯因推理方面的局限性，特别是在战略推理和假设更新方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索代理方法虽然提升了问答基准测试的性能，但忽视了中间推理步骤的质量，可能导致思维链不忠实的问题。

Method: 提出VERITAS框架，在强化学习过程中集成三种忠实度指标的信息-思维忠实度、思维-答案忠实度和思维-搜索忠实度作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，使用VERITAS训练的模型在七个问答基准测试中不仅显著提高了推理忠实度，还保持了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: VERITAS框架有效解决了RL搜索代理的推理忠实度问题，为开发更可靠的检索增强生成系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于输入数据分布的自适应激活引导方法IDS，能够根据输入在表示空间中的分布位置动态调整引导强度，在保持文本连贯性的同时实现有效的模型行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用固定引导强度，导致控制不足或过度干预，影响文本的合理性和连贯性。需要一种能够根据输入自适应调整引导强度的方法。

Method: IDS方法通过分析输入数据在表示空间中的分布，动态调整激活引导的强度。当输入位于分布内部时使用较弱干预，位于分布边缘时使用较强干预。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本而不会崩溃，特别适合实际应用场景。

Conclusion: IDS通过自适应引导强度解决了固定强度方法的局限性，在保持文本质量的同时实现了有效的模型行为控制。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user
needs and advancing personalized service.

*Yizhou Peng,Yukun Ma,Chong Zhang,Yi-Wen Chao,Chongjia Ni,Bin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出自适应CFG方案解决AR TTS模型中风格-内容不匹配问题，通过调整CFG强度来平衡情感表达和音频质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当TTS系统中的情感提示与文本语义内容冲突时，会导致语音不自然，影响细粒度情感控制的效果

Method: 基于大语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测不匹配程度，提出自适应CFG方案，根据检测到的不匹配程度调整CFG强度

Result: 自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，显著提升了AR TTS模型的情感表达能力

Conclusion: 自适应CFG方案有效解决了AR TTS模型中的风格-内容不匹配问题，实现了更好的情感控制与音频质量平衡

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

*Pablo Miralles-González,Javier Huertas-Tato,Alejandro Martín,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，通过测量文本间的风格可转移性来解决作者身份问题，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算文体学方法依赖带虚假相关性的数据，经常混淆风格与主题。现代LLM的CLM预训练在作者身份问题中很少被利用，尽管在AI生成文本检测中自然使用。

Method: 利用LLM的广泛预训练和上下文学习能力，使用LLM的对数概率来测量从一个文本到另一个文本的风格可转移性。

Result: 该方法显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率。性能随基础模型大小一致扩展，在作者身份验证中通过增加测试时计算实现计算成本与准确性的灵活权衡。

Conclusion: 基于LLM预训练的无监督方法能有效解决作者身份问题，避免风格与主题混淆，且性能可随模型规模和计算资源灵活扩展。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应动态对话环境，使用意图感知奖励解决稀疏奖励问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随对话轮次演变，话语通常不完整需要上下文解释，需要查询重构以及检索和生成之间的动态协调，而静态的'重写、检索、生成'流水线无法满足这些需求。

Method: 基于强化学习的推理框架，交错进行搜索和推理，提出意图感知奖励机制提供轮次级反馈，使检索和推理与演变的用户目标对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现强劲，在五个CQA数据集上通过不同指标（F1、BERTScore、LLM-as-judge）均优于竞争模型，消融研究确认了意图感知奖励的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，能够跨领域稳健泛化。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出EBCAR，一种轻量级重排序框架，通过增强跨段落理解来解决RAG系统中需要跨段落推理的信息检索挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重排序方法虽然使用强大的预训练语言模型，但忽视了跨段落推理的挑战，如解决共指、消歧实体和聚合分散证据等。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落结构信息和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，捕获文档间高层交互和文档内低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出色，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有最先进的重排序方法。

Conclusion: EBCAR框架有效解决了RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战，在保持轻量级的同时实现了更好的检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，显著减少KV缓存的内存和运行时开销，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于稳定性假设（固定子集条目在生成过程中始终重要），但该假设本质脆弱，使均值聚合在极端情况下高度脆弱。

Method: 采用两步骤线性时间防御性聚合策略，控制最坏情况风险。DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV结合分层预算分配。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，分别将生成质量损失减少2.3倍和4.3倍，优于最强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存驱逐开辟了有前景的方向，并设定了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足受监管环境的需求。

Method: 采用基于低秩适配（LoRA）的微调特定类别适配器，在广泛的多模态数据集上进行训练，并使用教师辅助标注管道生成高质量、上下文感知的标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上都实现了最先进性能，超越了现有的开放和专有模型，包括WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: Protect为可信赖、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，利用NLP技术分析传统智慧

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展标注数据集包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析

Result: LLM能够准确识别谚语情感，希腊大部分地区负面情感谚语更普遍

Conclusion: LLM在非常规情感极性任务中表现良好，希腊谚语情感分布呈现地域特征

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习作为隐私保护训练方法被广泛应用，但ASR模型在此环境下的安全性尚未得到充分研究，需要评估其对属性推断攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 采用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下测试Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三种ASR模型，仅利用权重差分而不访问原始语音数据。

Result: 攻击能够成功推断敏感人口统计和临床属性，特别是口音信息可以从所有模型中可靠推断。预训练数据中代表性不足或缺失的属性更容易受到此类攻击。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦ASR模型中先前未记录的脆弱性，为改进安全性提供了见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

Motivation: NarrativeQA作为叙事文本问答领域最广泛使用的基准测试存在文档噪声和问答对质量问题，影响了评估的可靠性。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程识别和修正低质量问答样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本，构建高质量的LiteraryQA数据集。

Result: 所有基于n-gram的自动评估指标在系统级别与人类判断的相关性较低，而即使是小型开源权重的LLM评估方法也能与人类排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA提供了一个更可靠的叙事文本问答评估基准，LLM评估方法比传统n-gram指标更适合用于此类任务的系统评估。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关的框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来保持多轮对话的事实和逻辑一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在多轮对话中存在事实不一致和逻辑衰退问题，传统方法如RAG和agentic working memories仍使用静态知识源和单一推理路径，无法适应动态变化的对话上下文。

Method: 提出D-SMART框架，包含两个组件：(1)动态结构化记忆(DSM)，增量构建和维护对话的知识图谱；(2)推理树(RT)，在知识图谱上执行可追踪的多步推理。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有方法，将对话一致性分数提升超过48%，并将开源模型的质量分数提升高达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话中的一致性问题，并引入了更好的NLI-based评估指标来衡量对话一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的公共讨论具有交织冲突的观点、分歧的关注点、目标和情感倾向，以及隐含的假设和背景知识。目前缺乏大规模基准来评估LLM在真实世界人类意图理解方面的能力。

Method: 构建了\bench基准，这是同类中最大最多样化的基准，支持实时更新，并通过自动化筛选管道防止数据污染。

Result: \bench是首个专门针对意图理解的动态实时评估基准，特别是在消费者领域。

Conclusion: 该基准填补了评估LLM在真实世界人类意图理解能力方面的空白，为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯说服框架的自然语言说服方法，通过承诺-沟通机制增强LLMs的战略说服能力，在单轮对话中显著提升了说服成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略运用或依赖强假设。本文旨在探索贝叶斯说服在自然语言中的应用，提升LLMs的战略说服能力。

Method: 提出了承诺-沟通机制，说服者通过叙述潜在类型（如诚实或不诚实）明确描述信息模式，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。评估了半正式自然语言和全自然语言两种变体。

Result: 实验发现：1）基于BP策略的LLMs说服成功率显著高于非BP基线；2）SFNL具有更好的可信度和逻辑一致性，FNL在自然对话中表现出更强的情感共鸣和鲁棒性；3）通过监督微调，小模型可以达到与大模型相当的BP性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效增强LLMs的战略说服能力，不同变体在不同场景下各有优势，且模型规模不是决定性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

Motivation: 探索生成代理模型能否在模拟现实世界环境中有效建模心理理论，检验GPT-4是否能够从社会情境进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia框架，评估GPT-4在模拟环境中执行任务时是否基于信念归因选择行动。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，在生成代理行动连贯因果效应方面存在困难，表明其心理理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前关于LLMs中心理理论能力涌现的说法，强调需要更严格的基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理大小和解码吞吐量。

Method: 将token选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束来减少KV传输。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持接近无损性能的同时，解码吞吐量比基线提升2.3倍。

Conclusion: NOSA通过显式局部性约束有效支持KV缓存卸载，解决了稀疏注意力在批处理推理中的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Motivation: 语言意义如何演化及其决定因素尚不完全清楚，共词化现象为研究跨语言意义变化动态提供了有价值的窗口。

Method: 应用系统发育比较模型分析三个语系的词典数据，评估关联性、借用性和使用频率三个预测因子对概念对共词化的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系树中更广泛共词化且变化较慢；高频和易借用的概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念对的演化动态受多重因素影响，且区域和文化因素可能在共词化模式中发挥作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于公开目录的指令微调，显著提升了开源LLM在德语肿瘤诊断ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3编码任务中的准确性，特别是将ICD-10-GM的精确编码准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国医疗文档中需要准确编码肿瘤诊断，但开源LLM在德语语境下编码准确性不足，需要探索通过指令微调提升其性能的方法。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了超过50万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调。

Result: 微调后ICD-10-GM精确编码准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分编码准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率也有提升但相对较低；模型输出格式错误率降至0%。

Conclusion: 利用公开目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的性能，微调后不同规模模型间的性能差距缩小，推理模式性能较低且速度慢。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

Motivation: 语音适配的LLMs在语言理解任务上表现不如文本模型，存在文本-语音理解差距。现有方法依赖大规模语音合成或专有数据集，需要更数据高效的替代方案

Method: SALAD方法结合跨模态蒸馏与针对性合成数据，通过主动选择和跨模态蒸馏来改善对齐同时减轻遗忘

Result: 在3B和7B LLMs上，SALAD使用比公开语料库少一个数量级的语音数据，在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准上达到与强开源模型竞争的性能

Conclusion: SALAD提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小文本-语音理解差距，通过分析差距的两个驱动因素并针对性解决

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

TL;DR: M^2PO是一个用于机器翻译的多对多视角偏好优化框架，通过整合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分来改进奖励信号，并利用多对构造策略从所有翻译候选中学习，显著提升了翻译质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的机器翻译方法存在两个主要问题：质量估计模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；数据利用效率低下，仅选择单一胜负对而丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含多视角奖励引擎（结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分）和多对构造策略（从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对集合）。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对学习策略，实现了更鲁棒和忠实的翻译，为机器翻译的偏好优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为结构感知的过程，为LLM推理的透明有效优化提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试受到LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡的影响，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科实时收集表格数据生成基准测试，支持英语、德语、俄语和法语等多种语言。

Result: LLM从新收集表格生成的见解在自动指标上明显较差，但这在LLM和人类评估中并未体现；领域效应在所有评估中都很明显。

Conclusion: 领域平衡的基准测试更具挑战性，FreshTab有效解决了数据污染问题并支持多语言评估。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoTime是一个记忆增强的时间知识图谱框架，通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习来增强LLM的时间推理能力，在多个时间QA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间理解方面存在困难，特别是在涉及多实体、复合算子和演化事件序列的问题上。现有基于时间知识图谱的LLM推理方法面临四个主要挑战：保持多跳推理的时间忠实性、实现多实体时间同步、适应不同时间算子的检索，以及重用先前的推理经验。

Method: MemoTime将复杂时间问题分解为时间层次树，实现算子感知推理，强制执行单调时间戳并在统一时间边界下共同约束多个实体。动态证据检索层自适应选择算子特定的检索策略，而自演化的经验记忆存储已验证的推理轨迹、工具包决策和子问题嵌入以供跨类型重用。

Result: 在多个时间QA基准测试上的综合实验表明，MemoTime实现了整体最先进的结果，比强基线高出24.0%。此外，MemoTime使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习有效解决了时间推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了LLM的时间理解能力，并为较小模型提供了接近顶级模型性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了基于采样的解码策略对LLM生成文本检测器性能的影响，发现即使微小的解码参数调整也会严重损害检测器准确性，AUROC可能从接近完美降至1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成文本检测器在固定生成设置下报告接近完美的准确率，但其在解码策略变化下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 系统性地检查基于采样的解码如何影响可检测性，重点关注模型在（子）词级别分布的细微变化对检测性能的影响。

Result: 即使对解码参数（如温度、top-p或核采样）进行微小调整，也会严重损害检测器准确性，在某些设置下AUROC从接近完美水平降至1%。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前检测方法的关键盲点，强调需要更全面的评估协议。作者发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，一个多维度的AI临床医生系统评估范式，涵盖认知深度(G)、答案完整性(A)、鲁棒性(P)和安全(S)四个维度，并开发了全自动的基准构建流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI临床医生系统基准测试无法捕捉真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发了全自动的指南锚定流程，构建证据邻域，创建双图和树表示，自动生成跨G级别的问题，使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准，并由LLM评委进行评分。

Result: 验证显示自动生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估最先进模型发现关键失败模式：性能随推理深度增加而急剧下降，模型在答案完整性方面表现不佳，对对抗性扰动和某些安全问题高度脆弱。

Conclusion: 这种自动化的、基于临床的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全、更可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

TL;DR: 评估聊天助手在事实核查中的网络搜索行为，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的一致性，发现不同助手在引用可信来源方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天助手集成网络搜索功能虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也可能放大低可信度来源的错误信息，需要系统评估其搜索行为。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个易产生错误信息主题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat等助手，分析来源可信度和回答与引用来源的一致性。

Result: 不同助手表现各异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上更多地引用了不可信来源。

Conclusion: 这是首次对常用聊天助手的事实核查行为进行系统比较，为评估高风险信息环境中的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

*Zhiqi Huang,Vivek Datla,Chenyang Zhu,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu,Anoop Kumar,Ritesh Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前馈网络激活的置信度估计方法，用于检索增强生成系统，在金融行业应用中优于基线方法并满足延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如金融和医疗中，置信度估计至关重要，因为错误答案的成本远高于不回答问题。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，避免投影和softmax归一化造成的信息损失；将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，使用Huber损失正则化训练以提高对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Result: 在金融行业客户支持场景中，该方法优于强基线，在严格延迟约束下保持高准确率；在Llama 3.1 8B模型上，仅使用第16层激活即可保持准确率同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大规模训练的语言模型中符号接地的具体出现位置和驱动机制，这一问题目前尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制和因果分析系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的出现。

Result: 接地现象集中在中间层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础实现；该现象在多模态对话和不同架构中复现，但在单向LSTM中未出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据，表明符号接地可以在语言模型中自然涌现，对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过学习的专用令牌定期压缩生成KV缓存的方法，以解决长上下文推理中Transformer键值缓存线性增长带来的内存和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的严重限制，这会带来显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理令牌，过去生成令牌的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 通过修改的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型，定期使用学习的专用令牌压缩生成KV缓存并驱逐压缩条目。该方法利用强化学习输出进行蒸馏，最小化传统强化学习过程的开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确性帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练压缩技术。

Conclusion: 提出的KV缓存压缩方法通过联合蒸馏和强化学习框架，有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，实现了更好的内存-准确性权衡。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级压缩器，能够从检索文档中提取相关证据并生成简洁摘要，用于增强检索增强生成(RAG)系统，特别针对复杂多跳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务，扩展的上下文虽然提供更丰富信息，但导致更高延迟和模型认知负担增加，需要解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 使用相对较短上下文(少于1k词)的种子数据训练BRIEF-Pro，使其能够对超过10k词的扩展上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩平均提升4.67%的QA性能，仅需其23%的计算开销。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一个通用轻量级压缩器，能有效压缩扩展上下文生成相关摘要，显著提升RAG系统性能同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种低计算成本的元提示技术，用于在零样本情况下引导LLM进行人类对齐的异常处理，显著改善LLM的规则僵化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能代理推理引擎时存在规则僵化问题，即过度遵循显式规则而忽视人类常识和意图，这阻碍了可信自主代理的构建。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并证明最终决策，是一种零样本元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要细致判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，并产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、易用且有效的方法，将LLM从字面指令遵循转向目标导向推理，为更可靠实用的AI代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现标准强化学习下规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，揭示存在未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的令牌级优势函数，为高熵令牌分配更大更新；2）选择性加权规划密集型样本的优势函数。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试中，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并以显著更低的训练预算实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效解决了LLM增强代理在复杂任务中的规划能力不足问题，为长视野规划任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时序逻辑的LLM具身智能体物理安全评估框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观LLM判断，缺乏对物理安全的形式化精确评估。需要建立能够精确指定状态不变性、时间依赖性和时序约束的严谨安全评估框架。

Method: 使用时序逻辑将自然语言安全需求形式化为TL公式，构建三级验证管道：语义层验证LLM对安全需求的理解与TL公式对齐；规划层验证高层动作计划是否违反TL公式；轨迹层将执行轨迹合并为计算树，针对物理细节TL规范进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现Sentinel能够暴露被先前方法忽略的安全违规，并提供对失败模式的深入洞察。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层次应用验证方法，Sentinel为在物理环境中系统评估LLM具身智能体提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

TL;DR: 提出基于微调大语言模型的框架，自动从车祸叙述文本中推断驾驶员危险行为，提高分类的有效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车相撞事故占道路事故约70%，但人工编码驾驶员危险行为数据存在不一致性和劳动密集问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车事故数据，微调Llama 3.2 1B模型处理详细事故叙述，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统机器学习分类器进行基准比较。

Result: 微调LLM达到80%总体准确率，优于所有基线模型，在数据不平衡场景中表现尤其突出。通过概率推理方法分析模型输出变化，发现分心驾驶显著增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率，双驾驶员分心最大化"双方危险行为"概率，青少年驾驶显著增加"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动化驾驶员危险行为检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，利用LLMs的深层推理能力，整合多模态输入，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 通过将时间序列分析与LLMs的推理能力结合，能够实现更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 时间序列分析需要从传统模式识别转向以LLMs为推理工具的方法，强调因果解释和透明性，以应对现实世界的复杂性。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于偏好的奖励修复框架，通过从人类偏好中学习加性的状态转移相关修正项，来修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，从而解决奖励函数与真实目标不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不一致，仅作为代理目标；而从头学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架通过目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，识别关键状态转移并学习加性修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中，PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好学习RL方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从头学习奖励函数或其他修正方法，需要更少偏好就能学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR提供了一种高效的方法来修复代理奖励函数，结合了人工设计奖励和偏好学习的优势，显著减少了所需的人类偏好数据量。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Conclusion: 提出的情感认知框架成功实现了基于LLM代理与人类之间的情感对齐，显著提升了代理行为的生态效度和人类相似性。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 虽然链式思维提示和深度推理能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都应用深度推理计算成本过高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如果答案正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM执行深度推理。

Result: 对于简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统能有效平衡计算效率和任务性能，为LLM应用提供了一种实用的成本优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时动态学习复杂技能，在新环境中表现受限，这严重影响了其实际应用价值。

Method: EvoTest进化测试时学习框架：包含执行游戏的Actor代理和分析游戏记录以提出改进配置的Evolver代理，通过重写提示、更新记忆、调整超参数和学习工具使用例程来改进系统。

Result: 在J-TTL基准测试中，EvoTest持续提升性能，优于反射、仅记忆基线和复杂在线微调方法，是唯一能赢得两个游戏的方法。

Conclusion: EvoTest框架有效解决了AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能的挑战，为构建更实用的AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

TL;DR: 提出了状态-动作联合攻击(SAJA)框架，通过协同利用状态和动作扰动来攻击多智能体深度强化学习模型，相比单独的状态或动作攻击更有效且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究只关注状态攻击或动作攻击，没有考虑如何有效联合两者。简单随机组合状态和动作扰动无法发挥它们的协同效应。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升方法结合演员网络和评论家网络计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态使用评论家网络生成最终对抗动作。还添加了衡量扰动动作与原始动作距离的启发式正则化器。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle Environment(MPE)中评估表明，SAJA优于单独的状态或动作攻击，更隐蔽，且现有防御方法无法防御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架通过协同状态和动作攻击有效提升了多智能体深度强化学习模型的攻击效果，现有防御方法难以应对这种联合攻击。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理，在数学推理任务中优于现有免训练奖励方法，甚至超越大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而免训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽能利用LLM内在推理能力，但使用置信度作为奖励的概念尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 提出CRew方法，使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励指标，特别适用于封闭式任务。基于此提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度分数和正确性信号构建偏好数据。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有免训练奖励方法，甚至超越大多数训练过的奖励模型。CRew分数与模型实际推理性能强相关，并能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的免训练奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程对人类和较弱代理变得越来越难以理解，这削弱了可解释性和监督能力。需要开发方法使强模型能够产生对较弱协作者可理解的解决方案。

Method: 引入tandem training强化学习范式，在训练过程中随机从冻结的弱模型而非强模型中采样rollout tokens，只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能够被弱模型继续时，rollout才能成功。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，tandem training可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，适应较弱伙伴的语言，同时保持高任务准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可被较弱代理审计的AI系统提供了一条有前景的途径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

Conclusion: Empower方法为大规模构建有用且对齐的AI助手提供了框架，仅需离线数据，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前的标记-阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更有效地保障智能体AI的安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

*Shrey Pandit,Austin Xu,Xuan-Phi Nguyen,Yifei Ming,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hard2Verify是一个人工标注的步骤级验证基准，用于评估前沿LLM在数学问题中的步骤验证能力，发现开源验证器普遍落后于闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IMO 2025等数学竞赛中，LLM推理系统需要确保每个证明步骤不仅正确且得到充分支持，因此需要强大的步骤级验证器来捕捉错误。

Method: 构建了Hard2Verify基准，包含500多小时人工标注，评估29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型在步骤级验证任务上的表现。

Result: 除了少数表现优异者外，开源验证器普遍落后于闭源模型。研究还分析了性能差的原因、验证器计算规模的影响以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Conclusion: Hard2Verify为评估前沿步骤级验证器提供了严格基准，揭示了开源验证器与闭源模型之间的性能差距，并为理解验证机制提供了深入分析。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
