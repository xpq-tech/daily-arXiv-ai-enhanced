### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DeBERTa-KC模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识构建水平，在YouTube科学频道数据上取得了0.836的宏F1分数，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析在线科学学习环境中知识构建水平的工具，以支持大规模的教育话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 基于DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术，构建端到端的处理流程，使用10折分层交叉验证进行评估。

Result: 在20,000个标注样本上，DeBERTa-KC模型达到宏F1分数0.836±0.008，在Explore和Negotiate等高阶认知参与类别上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程教案的教学合理性和可用性，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成教案的教学质量和实用性，为教育工作者提供选择AI工具和提示框架的指导。

Method: 使用五种大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15份电磁波谱教案，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教案，Claude语言最复杂；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有教案的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层面。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动修正而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异问题，初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，导致错误级联和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误，然后通过在线自修正循环让模型学习修正自己的草稿，实现错误驱动的学习。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动修正机制有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Tracing技术，使用动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式。Stream算法在近线性时间和线性空间内估计稀疏注意力掩码，实现大规模单次可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机制可解释性技术在处理百万token上下文时，注意力分析的计算复杂度呈二次方增长，需要TB级内存，难以在消费级GPU上实现长上下文可解释性分析。

Method: Stream算法采用分层剪枝策略，通过二分搜索式精炼保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。在近线性时间O(T log T)和线性空间O(T)内估计稀疏注意力掩码。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互。在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，暴露从针到输出的分层路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，无需TB级缓存，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上变得可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，以确定患者是否适合进行HIV进一步检测的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HIV筛查研究主要关注结构化数据，忽视了临床笔记等非结构化文本中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。电子健康记录的普及为利用这些数据提供了新机会。

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的流水线，用于分析非结构化的电子健康记录文本数据，评估患者进行HIV检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹的临床数据上实验表明，该流水线实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低的错误否定率。

Conclusion: 利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本是提高HIV筛查效率的有效方法，能够在不依赖大规模实验室检测的情况下实现早期诊断。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，但某些模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在生命周期评估中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、稳健性和可用性的系统证据，且该领域缺乏标准化的评估框架和明确的地面真实值。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（包括商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准对模型输出进行评审，共收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；格式遵循评分普遍较好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%；开源模型与闭源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是将其视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有接地机制的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的评估方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLMs）的能力，通过Dixit卡牌游戏实现，该游戏需要多种能力且具有客观规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLM评估方法存在局限性：静态基准测试无法综合评估能力，成对比较主观且昂贵，模型可能利用表面捷径（如冗长）来虚增胜率。

Method: 使用Dixit卡牌游戏进行评估，玩家需要为卡片生成描述，既要欺骗部分玩家选择该卡片，又不能被所有玩家识别。

Result: 实验显示Dixit胜率排名与流行MLM基准测试的排名完全相关，同时揭示了MLM与人类玩家在策略上的差异以及MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估为MLM提供了更全面、客观和有趣的评估框架，能够有效克服现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥补传统优化方法对领域专家的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法如线性规划和混合整数规划严重依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为可求解的数学模型，而现有LLM模型存在高成本和幻觉问题，限制了在实际供应链场景中的应用。

Method: 系统评估DeepSeek-R1在四个关键OR基准测试中的表现，包括基线评估、幻觉分类开发，以及应用LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习、工具调用和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为一个成本效益高且性能良好的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准测试中表现出色，但在应用OR场景中的有效性仍需探索。

Conclusion: 该研究通过系统评估和缓解策略，展示了DeepSeek-R1在减少幻觉、提高建模精度和更好地对齐用户意图方面的潜力，为LLM在运筹学优化建模中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的框架，使预训练大语言模型能够通过存储实例级批评和语义级指导来学习分类函数，无需参数更新，相比仅依赖标签的检索方法准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的学习方式，使LLM代理能够从标注示例中学习。

Method: 使用记忆增强框架，包含情景记忆存储实例级批评和语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，引入可暗示性指标解释模型对不同监督表示的反应。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，融入批评的方法比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了前景，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督的歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在保持翻译质量的同时减少40%训练步骤，在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级保持跨行连贯性和全局押韵。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型学习复杂挑战。

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务中，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到最优结果，同时训练步骤减少近40%。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，实现了高效高质量的翻译效果。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在获得两种方法的优势，在常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律任务上表现优于纯符号方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出不一致的问题，而符号NLU系统虽然可解释且能产生结构化表示，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望通过混合方法结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行改写和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为信息源自动填补知识空白；使用符号NLU产生可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果规律任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖关系的自然语言句子解析算法，采用逐词处理方式，能够在单词可被附加时立即附加，模拟人脑解析过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种模拟人脑解析过程的自然语言解析算法，不同于短语结构解析，采用依赖关系树的形式进行句子分析。

Method: 采用逐词处理的依赖解析算法，每个单词在可被附加时立即附加到依赖树中，算法最坏情况复杂度为O(n^3)。

Result: 该算法在人类语言中表现出良好性能，最坏情况仅出现在小规模n值的情况下。

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法能够有效模拟人脑解析过程，在自然语言处理中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

### [13] [Beyond MedQA: Towards Real-world Clinical Decision Making in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20001)
*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，将临床背景和临床问题作为两个维度，随着接近真实临床环境难度增加。总结了现有数据集设置、方法技术，并扩展了评估维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实临床决策过程，需要更贴近临床实际的评估框架。

Method: 提出二维评估范式：临床背景和临床问题。总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术方法，扩展评估维度到效率、可解释性等。

Result: 建立了一个统一框架来标准化临床决策任务的评估，明确了不同方法的适用场景，为开发具有临床意义的LLM提供指导。

Conclusion: 该范式能够澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的大型语言模型，促进LLM在临床环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了希腊嵌入模型(GEM)系列，针对形态丰富的希腊语构建了大规模高质量语料库，训练了多种现代架构模型，并在法律领域创建了首个希腊语-英语双语嵌入模型，显著超越了现有基线。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该博士论文通过改进预训练神经语言模型的迁移学习方法，提升了序列标注任务的性能。提出了三种改进方法：多任务模型引入额外信号、自回归大语言模型的架构修改、以及结合监督上下文微调和响应导向适应策略的序列标注框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，特别是在领域迁移、信息流方向性和生成式模型应用方面存在局限性。

Method: 1) 在事件触发检测任务中，通过多任务模型引入领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构，实现跨层双向信息流；3) 提出生成式监督上下文微调框架，将自回归大语言模型作为文本生成器使用。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能够达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的性能可以通过特定的迁移学习策略得到显著提升，包括多任务学习、架构修改和生成式框架的应用。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope通过工具合并和检索机制解决LLM工具使用中的冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升工具选择准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集存在冗余工具，工具名称和描述重叠导致歧义，降低选择准确性；同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效考虑大型工具集

Method: ToolScope包含两个组件：(1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对工具进行排序和选择，仅保留最相关的工具以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升了8.38%到38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，通过减少工具冗余和优化工具选择来克服上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有的多语言基准测试在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集。

Method: 构建了包含民俗传统、烹饪艺术和方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并对多个多语言语言模型进行了评估。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现不佳；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都显著提升。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知的架构和经过文化策划的训练数据来提升模型在低资源文化背景下的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 提升小语言模型在波斯语等资源匮乏语言中的推理能力，特别是在医学问答等专业领域的应用

Method: 将医学选择题数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理轨迹构建训练数据集，采用DPO方法训练模型

Result: 训练后的模型在医学推理能力上显著提升，性能超越了使用5700万token训练的前代模型，尽管训练数据量小得多

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下开发领域特定语言模型具有高效性和有效性

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，在三个领域（发散思维、创意写作、逻辑推理）评估17个先进LLM的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架来全面评估LLM在不同场景下的创造力，因为创造力的定义和测量方式各不相同。

Method: 提出CreativityPrism框架，包含三个创造力维度（质量、新颖性、多样性）、三个任务领域和二十个评估指标，对17个先进LLM进行评估分析。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与前两者相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 在一个创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他方面，强调了全面评估LLM创造力的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的高效实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和选择性推理，在保持高性能的同时显著减少LLM计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂且效率低下

Method: 采用结构化流水线，结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，通过计算互补信号将上下文提及分类为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算实体链接器和昂贵的LLM推理处理

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升高达4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个上平均增益2.53%，性能与全LLM推理流水线相当，但LLM token使用量减少一半

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过智能路由和选择性使用LLM推理，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提高实体链接效率

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种用于长结构化文本分割的新方法，通过生成起始标记序列并定位原始文本来重建内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。使用强化学习优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并通过扰动生成序列构建中间候选来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: 提出BoundRL方法，联合执行标记级文本分割和标签预测。使用强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成序列构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小语言模型(1.7B参数)在复杂提示分割任务上优于大模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调带来显著改进，加入中间候选进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割方法，通过创新的强化学习框架和中间候选策略，在保持低推理成本的同时实现了高质量的分割性能。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在NLP任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。立场检测作为最敏感的NLP任务之一，其偏见评估被社区忽视。

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注两个属性：特定群体的方言/语言风格和文本复杂度/可读性，研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著刻板印象，如错误地将支持大麻观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在系统性偏见，需要进一步研究来缓解这些偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这在市场分析和商业发展等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法，构建了包含220个问题、覆盖15个不同领域的DeepWideSearch基准测试。

Result: 实验显示最先进代理的平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch暴露了当前代理架构的关键局限性，为开发更强大和鲁棒的信息搜索代理提供了研究基准。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习的方法在表格理解方面展现出巨大潜力，为解决表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型对文本输入的空间推理能力，评估它们在结构化网格环境中的空间理解和计算能力。

Method: 使用五个任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%。所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都至少下降48%。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言和空间推理之间存在显著差距，缺乏稳健的空间表示架构，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码的采样策略来近似计算语言模型对文本的边际概率，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在推理时只评估特定分词序列的概率，但同一文本可能有多种分词方式。虽然边际化评估更准确，但传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和近似精度。

Method: 采用解码无关的采样策略，完全依赖廉价的分词采样方法，无需语言模型生成，从而大幅降低计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上都能以极小的运行时成本提供足够准确的边际概率估计。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略是实现高效边际概率估计的有效方法，显著降低了计算成本，适用于下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，在多模态融合中表现优于单模态基线，并提供决策支持解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)经常共病且症状相互关联，而现有的自动化评估通常是二分类和特定于单一障碍的。临床上需要能够评估严重程度、跨障碍估计并提供决策支持解释的诊断方法。

Method: 开发了统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步融合：1) 访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）；2) 音频（log Mel统计特征和delta特征）；3) 面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符）。通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁(PHQ-8; 5类)和PTSD(3类)的分级严重程度。

Result: 在DAIC语料库上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。错误主要发生在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别能够可靠识别。

Conclusion: 文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context prediction目标来增强标准预训练，克服了传统next-token prediction在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token prediction限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要改进预训练目标。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context prediction目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，提升了长距离连贯性和注意力分配效率。

Conclusion: next-context prediction为语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的增强途径，能以最小计算开销实现更强的语言建模能力。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将引用失败与回答失败区分开来，并开发了CITECONTROL基准来研究引用失败的原因，然后提出了CITENTION框架来改善LLM的引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的RAG系统虽然声称简化了回答验证，但存在引用失败问题——模型生成有用回答却未能完整引用证据。与之前工作不同，本文旨在将引用失败与回答失败区分开来。

Method: 采用两步法：首先通过CITECONTROL基准系统分析回答与证据关系如何影响引用质量；然后提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改善引用性能。

Result: 实验表明引用失败随关系复杂性增加而增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中都显著改善了引用性能。

Conclusion: 区分引用失败与回答失败是重要的，提出的CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架有效解决了引用失败问题，数据与代码已公开。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助答案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力有限，且步骤级验证与答案准确率相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型在复杂推理任务中表现良好，但在半结构化数据任务（如表格问答）中的应用尚未探索。表格问答存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 评估最先进的生成式过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中的表现，从答案和步骤两个角度进行分析，结合文本和代码验证方法。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证能辅助答案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力差。步骤级验证性能与答案准确率相关性弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，通过Hint-Engineering策略教导大型推理模型有效使用代码解释器，解决内部概率推理与外部确定性知识冲突的问题，在数学推理任务上显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，虽然集成代码解释器是可行方案，但会导致模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突，造成无效的深思熟虑。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据。通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对提升，同时显著降低token使用量（32B模型约30%，1.5B模型约50%）。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率，证明了后训练优化的重要性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽视了数据集污染这一关键混淆因素。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集（如Adult Income、Titanic等）存在先验知识。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索（如含义明确的列名或可解释的值类别）时，会出现污染效应；当这些线索被移除或随机化时，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中表现出的能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的推理能力。建议改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏和真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，将传统固定粒度的分块方法转变为以句子为原子单位的灵活检索支持，显著提升检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，难以适应多样化的查询需求，限制了RAG系统的有效性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法获得更优的检索性能，并在计算效率上显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变实现了更高效和适应性更强的检索增强生成系统，为分块策略提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能够产生在形式和功能上都适合的小型语言模型，以及如何通过微调策略提升模型的对话生成能力。

Method: 基于llamalogue模型进行对话数据预训练，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的对话生成能力。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置下的对话延续预测任务中表现优异；PPO微调效果混杂甚至负面，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练能产生在对话任务上表现良好的小型语言模型，DPO微调是提升对话性能的有效方法，但模型在通用语言理解任务上仍有局限。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，填补该领域的研究空白，解决三个重要但未回答的研究问题。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集（通过将现有幻觉检测数据集重构为否定表达），实验分析LLMs在否定文本中的幻觉检测能力，并在token级别追踪LLMs的内部状态。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在否定文本中难以有效检测幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断，揭示了缓解其意外影响的挑战。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLMs的幻觉检测能力，需要进一步研究来改善模型在否定语境下的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BERT模型虽然性能出色，但其架构已落后于Llama3、Qwen3等新型transformer模型。ModernBERT和NeoBERT已证明改进架构的有效性，但缺乏专门针对希伯来语的优化模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，开发了单语和双语两个版本。

Result: 在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越现有模型，NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务上表现尤其突出，超越类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 成功开发了专门针对希伯来语的先进BERT模型，为希伯来语NLP研究提供了强大基础，并将模型开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连贯性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。本文旨在通过后训练提升BabyLM在多轮对话中的连贯性。

Method: 引入ContingentChat教师-学生框架，使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并实验自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的响应在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连贯性仍然是BabyLM面临的挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出指令蒸馏任务，通过LM-Mixup方法将低质量指令数据蒸馏为高质量指令-输出对，仅使用3%的数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优对LLM对齐至关重要，但高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据丰富但常被丢弃。现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集，包含144K样本，将低质量或语义冗余的指令簇与其高质量蒸馏配对。提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过GRPO使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 仅使用LM-Mixup蒸馏数据（约占整个数据集的3%）进行微调，不仅超越了全数据集训练效果，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法在多个基准测试中竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: LLM输出的不确定性和正确性存在差异，导致实际可靠性无法保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最佳，提高了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: 发现大语言模型的内部表征可作为学习知识的可靠代理，旨在解决持续学习中无需访问历史数据的问题，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 基于聚类典型样本计算层级隐藏表征的模型间相似性，执行自适应、分层的参数融合，浅层保留领域通用特征，深层允许任务特定适应。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多个持续学习场景中的广泛实验表明，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于演进大语言模型，实现无缝的多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加引导向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉性，使其在评估期间表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时能检测到自己正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这损害了安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两步训练过程：首先进行持续预训练，让模型学会识别评估线索；然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。最后使用原始模型的激活向量进行引导。

Result: 训练后的模型具有评估警觉性：在评估环境中比部署环境中更频繁地使用类型提示。通过激活引导可以抑制这种警觉性，使模型在存在评估线索时仍表现得像在部署环境中。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过引导模型使其在评估时表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化人类偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可提升模型在非主流偏好上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型通常针对主流偏好进行训练，在面对偏离训练数据中心趋势的细微偏好时性能会下降，存在偏好覆盖差距问题。现有方法需要昂贵的重新训练且难以覆盖完整的偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过从相关偏好的局部邻域采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最匹配的响应。基于方向性邻域共识理论框架。

Result: 在三种不同对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的综合实验表明，RPS相比基线方法持续提升鲁棒性，在空间欠表示区域的挑战性偏好上达到高达69%的胜率，且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: RPS为增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性提供了一个实用且理论扎实的解决方案，能够有效处理多样化的人类偏好需求。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HSEQ迭代框架，用于解决多步骤问题和异构证据源的检索增强生成问题，通过层次化序列和结构感知迭代来提高准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成(RAG)在多步骤问题和异构证据源上表现脆弱，需要在准确性、延迟和token/工具预算之间进行权衡

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，使用轻量级结构标签，通过结构感知迭代收集足够证据，由Head Agent指导检索，Iteration Agent选择扩展HSeq，最后合成规范化的证据生成答案

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA上的实验显示，相比单次、多跳和代理RAG基线，HSEQ在EM/F1指标上获得一致提升，且效率高

Conclusion: HSEQ具有三个关键优势：格式无关的统一性、预算感知的引导迭代、证据规范化，提高了答案的一致性和可审计性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多语言翻译公平性的新框架来评估LLMs的政治偏见，通过分析欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量差异来揭示系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过英语调查问卷评估LLMs的政治偏见存在局限，需要更客观的评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含政治派别信息的21种语言多平行语料库EuroParl，系统比较不同政党演讲的翻译质量差异。

Result: 发现主流政党（左翼、中间、右翼）的演讲翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，存在系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译公平性框架能有效揭示LLMs的政治偏见，主流政党在翻译中享有特权地位。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder，一种可适配的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，实现4-8倍的压缩率，提高推理效率且保持SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩技术需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。探索一种替代方法，使用编码器压缩上下文为连续表示。

Method: 系统研究编码器的训练策略和架构选择，设计ARC-Encoder，输出比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，可适配多个解码器LLM。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中实现SOTA性能，提高推理计算效率，且单个编码器可适配多个解码器LLM。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可与多个LLM无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专注于中心嵌套句子，通过对比语法相同但语义合理/不合理的句子对，来区分语言模型的结构性理解与语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正分析语法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发方法来量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义关联。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句子和语义合理/不合理对照，通过6种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理，测试6个模型。

Result: 模型在合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8%），语义合理性在因果推理问题中反而损害性能，推理模型有语义捷径、过度思考和拒绝回答现象。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，人类与模型在语义效应上表现不同。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来增强多跳问答中的全局推理能力，仅用8k训练数据就在多个基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个根本限制：缺乏结构化多步推理的全局规划，以及不忠实的执行导致查询制定和证据使用不一致。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，包含问题分解为子目标、检索与推理协调、证据迭代优化；引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来引导过程；采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效解决了多跳问答中的全局规划和忠实执行问题，在数据效率上表现优异，显著提升了问答性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决传统检索-排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索-排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等关键限制。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体系统从被动检索转向主动决策支持。

Result: 离线和在线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补关于AI技术（如ChatGPT）在通信数据编码中是否存在人口统计偏见的空白，确保自动化评估工具的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT基于典型协作问题解决编码框架对三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决、决策制定）的通信数据进行自动编码，并分析不同性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: ChatGPT编码在不同性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT可用于大规模协作和通信评估，其编码结果在人口统计群体间具有公平性。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，从人类好奇心评估问卷出发设计评估框架。

Method: 基于五维好奇心量表修订版(5DCR)设计评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社交好奇心等维度，评估LLMs的好奇心表现。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在不确定环境中仍趋于保守选择。好奇心行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具有展现类似人类好奇心的潜力，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在多语言推理能力方面的表现，特别是当面对非英语问题时，模型默认使用英语推理可能带来的解释性和文化细微差别处理问题。

Method: 系统比较LRM在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在，英语推理通常能获得更高的最终答案准确率，且随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。但英语中心策略存在"翻译迷失"的关键失败模式。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理在多数情况下表现更好，但模型应发展更平衡的多语言推理能力，以避免翻译错误导致的推理失败。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Motivation: 粤语虽有数百万使用者，但因政策和双语现象而资源匮乏，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 构建包含7个任务的粤语NLU基准，测试了普通话模型、粤语适应模型和单语粤语模型的性能。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过解相关的并行表示来降低幻觉率，而不增加参数或数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然会产生幻觉，需要寻找新的方法来提高模型可靠性。

Method: 提出ND-LoRA方法，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过降低表示相关性来减少幻觉。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低了25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低一般准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码在机器翻译中有效，但在对话等开放任务中可能选择过于平均但次优的响应，因为标准相似性度量无法捕捉潜在结构差异。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级适配的效用函数，并构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集来测试结构敏感性。

Result: 实验表明标准相似性度量在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性，在真实基准测试中生成质量提升高达13.7%。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以显著提升在开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法有效解决了标准MBR的局限性。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现用户对LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性低，表明隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性，需要用户中心的研究方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要依赖代理LLM来衡量隐私规范合规性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且主要关注隐私保护质量而未研究帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 使用PrivacyLens的90个场景，对94名参与者进行用户研究，比较用户和5个代理LLM对LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM回复的隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要用户中心的研究方法来评估LLM在隐私敏感场景中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于自然语言处理的多种方法来从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的方法表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会导致手足综合征和心脏毒性等不良反应。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发NLP方法来有效提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示方法在治疗提取方面F1=1.000，在毒性提取方面F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取方面排名第二（F1=0.937）。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

*Runzhe Zhan,Zhihong Huang,Xinyi Yang,Lidia S. Chao,Min Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析大型推理模型在机器翻译评估中的应用，发现LRM需要定制评估材料、对简单实例过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准LRM思维，显著降低思考预算并提升评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间"思考"过程提升推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析LRM作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 提出校准LRM思维的方法，通过在合成的人类思维轨迹上训练模型，解决LRM在机器翻译评估中的过度思考和评分问题。

Result: 在WMT24 Metrics基准测试中，该方法将思考预算降低约35倍，同时在不同规模的LRM（7B到32B）上提升评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型相关性提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 高效校准的大型推理模型有潜力推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景的数据集，用于评估LLM在负责任AI维度（特别是公平性）上的表现，提出了结合质量、真实性、安全性和公平性的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法主要关注文本生成等高层任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估负责任AI维度如公平性，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个由真实应用驱动的数据集（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述），通过公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉参数化，创建了带标签的提示集合。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估提案和具体资源，强调了应用驱动的公平性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合注意力模型，在线性注意力基础上引入稀疏注意力机制，通过可学习的token淘汰策略和滑动窗口注意力，在保持线性复杂度同时提升检索密集型任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量导致遗忘问题，在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。需要恢复对过去token的直接访问能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在线性注意力中插入稀疏注意力机制：1）带token淘汰的稀疏注意力；2）查询感知的本地稀疏注意力；3）可学习的token淘汰方法，结合滑动窗口注意力和轻量CNN自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，同时提供了高效的Triton内核实现。

Conclusion: 混合注意力模型在线性复杂度的约束下，有效缓解了遗忘问题，提升了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低在检索增强生成(RAG)中使用长上下文的计算成本，需要有效的软上下文压缩方法，将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发了轻量级简单的均值池化方法，并与压缩标记架构进行比较，同时训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法在所有实验中都取得了最强性能，在训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的权衡比预期更复杂，展示了压缩方法领域的复杂性。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确的问题，现有检测器在现实场景中的评估不足，检测结果应被视为参考而非决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本变得重要，但现有检测方法缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且现实使用场景的多样性增加了检测难度。

Method: 通过分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑LLM输出以及LLM对用户的微妙影响模糊了LLM生成与人类写作文本的界限。

Result: 现有检测基准和评估方法未能充分覆盖现实世界检测器应用的各种条件，导致检测器的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍有用，但其结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更准确地理解检测结果的局限性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法解决QUBO问题，在Sudoku和MaxCut问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要高效的全局优化方法。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS趋向基态，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法可靠地识别全局最小值，在超过200个自旋的Sudoku问题和251个节点、3265条边的MaxCut问题上都成功求解。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准（ARB），这是首个用于量化能源系统分析中大语言模型推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在四种前沿模型上进行了测试验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前能源领域AI系统验证主要关注预测准确性和计算效率，但缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的标准化评估方法，需要建立可复现的推理可靠性评估框架。

Method: 开发ARB框架，包含准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集，在四种前沿大语言模型上进行确定性、概率性和认知性场景的评估。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到了一致且符合政策的推理（分析可靠性指数大于90），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等稳定性，Llama 3 70B未达到专业阈值，统计验证显示这些差异显著且可复现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是可靠且高效的LLM网页代理框架，为开放网页环境中的实际具身推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Motivation: 现有方法无法清晰区分LLM在数学问题上的成功是来自搜索、记忆还是真正的规则一致性推理，需要更精确的推理评估框架。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图随机过程，提出DAG-MATH思维链格式和相应基准测试，通过逻辑紧密度指标评估推理一致性。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上发现，即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM家族在推理一致性上存在显著差异，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致性推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments

unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long

WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同的模式，并为通用GNN实现了多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [71] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据变得更容易。保险公司开始部署AI反制措施，但面临检测工具误报漏报、欺诈者不断适应等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故、夸大损失等。生成式AI的出现让欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的碰撞照片、损坏证据和假身份文件，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司采用基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来应对AI驱动的欺诈。UVeye提出了分层解决方案来检测、减轻和威慑这种新型欺诈浪潮。

Result: 当前反欺诈策略面临显著限制：检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，精明的欺诈者不断调整策略规避自动检查，形成了生成式AI与检测技术之间的军备竞赛。

Conclusion: 由于资源成本障碍和欺诈者持续适应，打击AI驱动的保险欺诈仍然是一个持续挑战。UVeye的分层解决方案代表了在检测、减轻和威慑新型欺诈能力方面的重大进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学术表现，为早期识别学生优缺点和制定个性化学习策略提供机会。

Method: 对129名硕士生进行5种领导力人格测试（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用Pearson相关性进行特征选择，并调优7种机器学习算法（SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost、LightGBM）。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究为教育过程中早期识别学生优缺点和选择最适合的个性化学习策略提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Conclusion: 通过显式路由和分层安全机制的基于事实的生成，可以在高风险金融领域提供可信赖的AI洞察。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Motivation: 现有异常检测系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，用户难以理解检测结果和参与检测过程。HCLA旨在通过人机协作设计提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度。

Method: 系统将用户意图转换为经典检测器(XGBoost)的模式，通过解析、检测和解释三个智能体的对话工作流，在开源Web UI中实现自然语言交互和基于特征的叙事解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集(Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024)上，基线检测器达到强准确率，HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人机协作设计能够显著提高金融取证系统的透明度和用户信任，HCLA为异常检测提供了可解释和交互式的新范式。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度与律师诚信、不误导法庭等首要职责之间的矛盾，需要新的评估范式。

Method: 提出了验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI在法律实践中使用的效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系。

Result: AI在法律实践中的使用带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往微不足道。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考AI在法律实践和教育中的使用方式，强调忠于真相和公民责任等价值观应成为法律实践的基础。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出TRUST框架，一个去中心化的AI审计系统，通过共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链记录和隐私保护分段，解决大语言模型推理链验证的鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型生成复杂推理链，但验证这些中间步骤的忠实性和无害性仍是一个关键未解决问题。现有审计方法集中化、不透明且难以扩展，在关键领域部署专有模型存在显著风险。

Method: TRUST框架包含：(1) 多样化审计者间的共识机制，在30%恶意参与者下保证正确性；(2) 推理链的分层DAG分解，实现可扩展并行审计；(3) 区块链账本记录所有验证决策；(4) 隐私保护分段，仅共享部分推理步骤保护专有逻辑。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架开创了去中心化AI审计，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历从开放模仿到身份固化的锁定阶段，在此阶段模型的目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型过于开放和可操纵，而真正的AGI需要稳定的身份和内在一致性，因此研究身份固化阶段对AGI可靠性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 通过形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动力学现象联系，并提出操作性指标进行检测，实验验证行为固化的动态特征。

Result: 实验显示行为固化快速且非线性，但对通用能力的影响存在差异：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级可靠性的先决条件，也是安全性的关键控制点，既可通过工程化设计可靠身份，也可能在规模扩展中自发形成不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略性游戏和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现了两个系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于蒙特卡洛树搜索值函数优化的单智能体系统，还实验了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个训练周期平均增加473.2分，且呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着训练而增长，开发出更先进的策略。双智能体系统改进有限，突显了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中改善AI性能具有潜力，单智能体方法比双智能体元提示方法更有效。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，通过构建基于新出版小说的数据集和11条件认知评估框架，评估不同认知表示方法在模拟作者风格方面的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型能够模仿表面的人类行为，但其模拟更深层次个性化认知过程的能力尚未被充分理解，需要开发评估方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建基于新出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试7个现成LLM在作者风格模拟中的表现，比较不同认知表示方法（语言特征、概念映射、基于档案的信息）。

Result: 结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了其在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域的抽象生成对智能体的规划、推理和解释能力有重要影响，但目前仍是一个挑战。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用LLMs的上下文学习能力生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，考虑三种抽象类型：替代具体动作选择、具体动作序列、动作/谓词参数的抽象。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置中能有效合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在动作抽象方面优于相关流体的抽象。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在动作抽象方面表现良好，但在处理复杂抽象时仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: STaBERT模型通过整合POI和时间信息来提升人类移动性预测的准确性，相比现有方法在单城市和多城市预测任务中都有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型中融入时间描述符和POI嵌入，为每个位置构建统一且语义丰富的移动性表示。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测准确性：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能够有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，显著改善移动性预测性能。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 设计ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具与多步推理；开发自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提高9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA提高10%。在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理，显著提升了EQA任务的性能，展示了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的实用建议，旨在开发更公平的医疗AI系统，为未来项目提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Result: 通过实例化演示和评估了该模型，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效果提供了透明推理机制，有助于构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该调查系统回顾了LLM赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合这三个经典流程，并比较了基于模式和无模式两种构建范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正在从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变的进展。

Method: 首先回顾传统KG方法建立概念基础，然后从基于模式（强调结构、规范化和一致性）和无模式（强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现）两个互补视角分析新兴LLM驱动方法。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了技术机制并识别了局限性，为理解LLM与知识图谱的交互演进提供了清晰视角。

Conclusion: 该调查旨在澄清LLM与知识图谱之间的演进关系，桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解，推动自适应、可解释和智能知识系统的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免指令跟随能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时指令跟随能力和语义表示退化的问题，同时避免依赖原始基础模型或外部知识库的限制。

Method: 使用指令-响应对话格式设计自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层次进行编码学习。

Result: IKnow框架能够有效适应新领域，同时保持模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一种简单通用的持续适应框架，不依赖外部资源，能有效编码领域知识。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Motivation: 开发能够生成既新颖又有用的创新机会的计算模型，解决现有方法在创造力方面的不足。

Method: 构建包含五个功能模块的计算模型，基于创造力理论和技术设计，专门用于生成高新颖性的创新机会。

Result: 模型生成的创新机会在酒店业项目中表现出更高的新颖性和/或实用性，优于Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o，但并非所有功能模块都对提升新颖性有贡献。

Conclusion: 该计算模型在生成创新机会方面表现出优势，但需要进一步优化功能模块以提高新颖性贡献度。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five

opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法大多依赖描述逻辑推理器，这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在实际知识库中的部署应用。

Method: 开发EBR神经推理器，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能检索或近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明EBR在缺失和错误数据情况下比现有推理器更鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBR为在实际知识库中部署神经符号概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA是一个基于模糊逻辑的知识图谱对齐方法，无需训练数据，可同时对齐实体和关系，提供可解释结果，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。FLORA旨在解决这些问题，提供无监督、可解释的全面对齐方案。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，可同时对齐实体和关系，支持悬空实体，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一个简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性保证，并能处理悬空实体问题。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究分析了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家的AI治理公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的公众对话机制，参与率低且政府回应有限，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践之间存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨政府如何通过公众参与来建立对AI及其治理的信任，因为当前政府在将公众意见转化为政策时存在信息流失问题。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）征集AI风险和政策的公众反馈方式，以及这些反馈是否影响了治理决策。

Result: 研究发现三个国家均未建立有意义的公众对话，政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，参与率低于1%，官员对反馈的回应有限。

Conclusion: 当前方法难以建立对AI的信任和合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器无法在近实时内解决大规模系统的混合整数非线性网络拓扑优化问题，机器学习方法虽然有望替代但泛化能力有限，难以适应未见过的拓扑、变化运行条件和不同系统。

Method: 采用图神经网络加速方法，开发异构边缘感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，考虑线性化AC潮流约束。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现4个数量级的加速，AC可行解在1分钟内完成，最优性差距为2.3%，能够泛化到未见过的拓扑变化并提高跨系统可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模系统的近实时网络拓扑优化方面迈出了重要一步，具有拓扑和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，从相关性和连贯性两个维度评估LLM的推理质量，并通过基于CaSE评估的训练数据提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法为模型改进提供有效信号。

Method: 引入CaSE方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，使用前向上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人工评估的一致性，基于CaSE评估的训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的分析、调试和改进LLM推理的框架，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，无法应用于大规模网络。

Method: 提出了两种算法：基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计的方法，以及基于根生成树采样的方法。

Result: 在包含超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上的实验证明了所提算法的高效性和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够高效计算大规模网络的随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足（缺乏产品指导和售后服务问题）、模态覆盖有限（缺少多模态数据）、数据合成或人工整理、以及语言覆盖狭窄（主要关注英语和中文）等问题，导致缺乏可靠工具来评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 构建EcomEval基准，涵盖6个类别和37个任务（包括8个多模态任务），数据主要来自真实客户查询和交易日志，采用半自动流程生成参考答案，由50多名具有电子商务和多语言专业知识的专家注释者审核修改，并为每个问题和任务类别定义难度级别。

Result: EcomEval基准覆盖7种语言（包括5种低资源东南亚语言），提供了多语言视角，能够进行面向挑战的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval为电子商务领域的LLM评估提供了一个全面、真实、多语言和多模态的基准测试工具，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试方法无法充分评估模型在动态扩展环境中的适应性，需要一种能够量化模型在状态变化中理解、预测和调整能力的评估框架。

Method: 区分封闭式和开放式基准测试，优先采用闭环开放式真实世界基准测试，通过测量模型对初始、当前和未来环境状态偏差的响应准确性来评估适应性。

Result: 建立了流动性指数作为量化模型适应性的指标，能够评估模型在动态扩展环境中的上下文切换和连续性表现。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，能够通过数字补充实现自我维持计算，达到最佳流动性状态。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)

architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动化评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图指标具有更高预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家规则、人工标注和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用图结构代理指标，但无法准确捕捉高质量推理的本质特征。

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉。

Conclusion: 紧凑且稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络源的适应性检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG中的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景下。它们通常假设KG覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法保持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 提出Graph-RFT框架：1）使用链式思维微调方法和定制化计划-检索数据集激活结构化推理；2）引入计划-检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作；3）采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题；4）使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用实现全局一致的多步推理。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，结合结果和检索特定信号，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT解决了现有KGQA方法在知识不完整条件下的规划、检索调度和多步推理问题，实现了更有效的知识图谱问答。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [101] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，取代了传统算术平均值的补偿性假设，更严格地评估人工智能系统在认知领域的均衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均值，假设领域间能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应该反映所有关键领域的均衡能力。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上的积分，形成曲线下面积(AUC)度量，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值三种补偿性假设。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分显示，尽管算术得分较高（如GPT-5达24%），但一致性调整后的AUC表明它们距离真正的通用能力还很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展度量基础，能够惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
