To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial\nvariants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues\nsuch as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models\noutperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation\nand often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning.

In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning.

However,\napplying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential\nand structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts.

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show\nthat the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust\ntarget representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a\nsingle A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be\nperformed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented\ndata-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can\nreliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such\nsteering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop\nmethods for detecting when such steering attempts occur.

First, we add news data\nand multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on\nthis, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to\nbetter integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs\nuse a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional\nmask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less\neffective than LoRA.
