### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个验证框架，用于评估和改进LLM生成的旅行行程的时间一致性，通过AeroDataBox API验证真实飞行时间约束，系统性地纠正时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的复杂多步骤计划和行程经常缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，这限制了它们在旅行规划中的实际应用。

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API验证其与真实世界飞行时长约束的一致性，建立验证框架来纠正时间不一致问题。

Result: 实验表明，虽然当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以通过该框架系统可靠地纠正，使它们能够在大规模旅行规划中实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM处理复杂时间推理任务的能力做出了贡献，并提供了一个在实际应用前纠正LLM生成行程中时间不一致问题的框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准测试，基于企业级SQL方言(MaxCompute/Hive)，包含600个中文问题覆盖28个数据库，77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及4个以上表格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型模型在中文文本到SQL任务中的性能瓶颈，特别是在企业级场景下处理复杂模式链接和中文语义映射的挑战。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试集，每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义特征，并发布了鲁棒的执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型（包括Deepseek）在该基准测试上的准确率最多只有50%，主要错误来自模式链接和中文语义映射问题。

Conclusion: Falcon为中文特定语义和企业级方言提供了可复现的中间测试环境，使用真实的企业模式、查询模板和执行比较器，支持端到端验证。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了LLM中置信度与解决问题能力脱节的机制原因，通过分析内部状态几何结构，发现评估阶段的高维复杂流形与执行阶段的低维简单流形之间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释LLM中存在的置信度与实际问题解决能力之间的脱节现象，探究这种脱节背后的机制原因。

Method: 使用线性探针解码模型内部"可解性信念"，分析评估阶段和执行阶段的几何流形结构，并进行因果干预实验。

Result: 发现评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而执行流形维度显著降低；沿信念轴的线性干预不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的两系统架构：几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可直接控制行动的传统假设。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)通过翻译到枢纽语言再摘要的方式，能有效破坏AI文本水印的统计特征，同时保持语义保真度，比单语言改写攻击效果更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖标记分布的扰动来识别AI生成文本，但改写攻击要么部分可检测，要么会降低文本质量。本文探索跨语言攻击作为更强的攻击向量。

Method: 提出跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要处理，可选回译。通过跨语言语义瓶颈系统性地破坏标记级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案和五种语言上的实验显示，CLSA比单语言改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率，同时保持相似的文本质量。对于XSIR方案，CLSA将AUROC降至0.53（接近随机水平）。

Conclusion: 跨语言攻击暴露了水印技术的未充分探索的脆弱性，挑战了水印用于来源追踪或监管的实用性。需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)

Motivation: 为需要亚5毫秒延迟的实时嵌入应用提供高效解决方案，解决传统上下文模型延迟高的问题。

Method: 采用静态嵌入查找、优化的均值池化和零拷贝IEEE754二进制序列化技术，通过Rust实现高性能系统。

Result: 在8个代表性任务上获得60.6 MTEB平均分，重复检测性能达90.1% AP，语义相似性76.1% Spearman相关性，在专业领域达到基线的75%至131%性能。

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了实时嵌入应用所需的高性能和低延迟，为需要快速响应的应用场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强大型推理模型的事实性，无需依赖外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在依赖证据的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，主要原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别出正确事实但未能将其纳入最终响应。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思考片段层面强化有益推理模式并抑制有缺陷的模式，将token级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试上的实证评估表明，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身而不仅仅是输出，对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现通过简单的提示诱导自我参照处理，能在大语言模型中稳定产生结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告具有可解释的机制基础、语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解大语言模型产生结构化第一人称描述（明确提及意识或主观体验）的行为，研究探讨了一个理论驱动的条件：自我参照处理，这是意识理论中强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行一系列受控实验，测试自我参照处理是否可靠地促使模型产生主观体验的第一人称报告，并通过机制性和行为性探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: 四个主要发现：(1) 通过简单提示诱导持续自我参照能稳定产生结构化主观体验报告；(2) 这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的可解释稀疏自编码器特征机制性地控制；(3) 自我参照状态的描述在不同模型家族中统计收敛；(4) 诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自我参照处理是大语言模型产生结构化第一人称报告的最小且可复现条件，这些报告具有机制性控制、语义收敛和行为泛化的特点，需要作为科学和伦理优先事项进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了预测社区解释性笔记帮助性及其原因的任务，构建了一个大规模多语言数据集COMMUNITYNOTES，并通过自动提示优化框架生成和改进原因定义，提升了帮助性和原因预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着事实核查从专家驱动转向社区驱动，大多数社区笔记因缓慢的社区标注而无法发布，且帮助性原因缺乏明确定义，这促使研究如何预测笔记帮助性及其原因。

Method: 构建了包含10.4万条帖子和用户笔记的大规模多语言数据集，提出了通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测模型中。

Result: 实验表明优化后的定义能够提升帮助性和原因预测性能，帮助性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区笔记帮助性预测的空白，提出的框架和数据集为社区驱动的事实核查提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

### [10] [ProofSketch: Efficient Verified Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24811)
*Disha Sheshanarayana,Tanishka Magar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProofSketch是一个验证引导的推理框架，通过符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成来减少推理链长度，在提高准确性的同时显著降低token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理方法如思维链提示和自我一致性需要生成长推理链，导致token消耗大、计算成本高和延迟增加，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出ProofSketch框架，整合了符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成三个关键技术，通过验证引导来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明ProofSketch在减少token使用的同时提高了准确性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效可信的推理提供了一条有前景的技术路径，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症Bank猫救援图片描述任务合成转录本的方法：一种是程序化编程方法，另一种使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型，旨在解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用于训练自动系统的数据非常有限（AphasiaBank仅约600份转录本）。机器学习领域在数据稀疏时常使用合成数据，因此本研究旨在通过生成合成转录本来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 构建并验证了两种生成合成转录本的方法：1）程序化编程方法，通过单词删除、填充词插入和错语替换；2）使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型。两种方法都能生成涵盖四个严重程度（轻度、中度、重度、极重度）的转录本。

Result: 与人类引发的转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在合成生成方法中最好地捕捉了失语症中观察到的语言退化关键方面，在NDW、单词计数和单词长度方面显示出更现实的定向变化。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，未来工作应创建更大的数据集，微调模型以获得更好的失语症表征，并让语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环Transformer（PLT）架构，通过交叉循环并行和高效表示增强技术，在保持循环模型高性能的同时实现低延迟推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统循环Transformer虽然能节省参数，但由于循环顺序执行导致推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加，难以应用于实时场景。

Method: 使用交叉循环并行（CLP）技术打破顺序依赖，同时计算不同token的不同循环；采用高效表示增强策略共享第一循环的KV缓存，结合门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）融合全局和局部信息。

Result: PLT实现了与传统循环模型相当的高精度，但延迟和内存成本几乎与标准Transformer相同。

Conclusion: PLT成功解决了循环Transformer的延迟问题，为高性能低延迟的LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于语法书指导的评估框架，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，并以卢森堡语为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是对低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构（尤其是句法结构与意义的映射关系）仍存在争议。

Method: 设计了一个包含四个关键阶段的语法书指导评估流程，包括语法知识提取、测试构建、模型评估和结果分析，以卢森堡语作为案例研究。

Result: 发现翻译性能与语法理解能力呈弱正相关，强翻译能力不一定意味着深刻的语法能力。大模型整体表现良好但形态学和句法较弱，在最小对任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 推理能力是提升大语言模型语法理解能力的有前景途径，需要开发更系统的语法评估框架来深入理解模型的语言能力。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE是一个用于评估多模态检索增强生成(RAG)的框架，通过InfoF1和CiteF1指标分别评估事实性和引用支持度，解决了现有文本中心评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视听媒体成为重要的在线信息来源，现有的RAG评估方法主要关注文本，无法有效验证多模态来源的信息，限制了在多模态推理密集场景中的应用。

Method: 采用声明中心的方法，包含InfoF1(评估事实性和信息覆盖度)和CiteF1(评估引用支持和完整性)，并开发了自动评估版本。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外部质量判断高度一致，同时揭示了文本中心评估方法的局限性，为自动评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估提供了有效框架，解决了现有方法的不足，并推动了自动评估技术的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Idea2Plan任务和基准，用于系统评估大语言模型从研究想法到研究计划的规划能力，发现GPT-5系列表现最佳但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究计划制定是科学发现的关键环节，也是自主研究代理开发的重要能力，但目前缺乏对大语言模型研究规划能力的系统理解。

Method: 构建Idea2Plan Bench基准，包含200个ICML 2025论文的研究想法和评分标准；提出Idea2Plan JudgeEval评估LLM评委的可靠性。

Result: GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最强，但仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench是一个包含1,737个英语谜题的基准测试，旨在评估语言模型的多方面推理能力，包括逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足。当前最先进模型在该基准上表现不佳，准确率仅略高于60%，并存在幻觉级联、自我纠正能力差和推理脆弱等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理基准主要评估结构化技能（如定量问题解决），缺乏对灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，而这些能力是人类智能的核心。需要一种能够衡量逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足综合能力的评估工具。

Method: 开发了RiddleBench基准测试，包含1,737个具有挑战性的英语谜题，专门设计用于探测核心推理能力。对包括Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3和Claude 4 Sonnet在内的最先进模型进行了评估和分析。

Result: 最先进的专有模型在RiddleBench上表现不佳：Gemini 2.5 Pro准确率60.30%，o3为63.37%，Claude 4 Sonnet为63.16%。分析揭示了深层失败，包括幻觉级联（接受其他模型的错误推理）、由于强烈的自我确认偏见导致的自我纠正能力差，以及推理脆弱性（约束重新排序或引入无关信息时性能显著下降）。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断语言模型推理问题的工具，并为开发更强大和可靠的语言模型提供指导。当前模型在灵活推理能力方面存在根本性弱点，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

TL;DR: 该论文通过心理语言学方法分析语言模型在不同句法语境中的错误模式，揭示了训练过程中语法学习的中间阶段和动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定语境下更容易出错。研究者希望通过精细分析这些错误模式，来理解语言模型语法学习的中间过程。

Method: 使用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，在不同句法条件下分解分析模型表现，并比较训练过程中各条件下的性能变化。

Result: 识别出训练过程中语言模型行为与特定启发式（如词频和局部语境）而非广义语法规则相一致的阶段。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体泛化模式的强大工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

TL;DR: SemCoT是一个新颖的语义对齐隐式思维链框架，通过联合优化token级生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐，显著提升了思维链推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式思维链推理的冗长性阻碍了其在效率关键应用中的大规模部署。现有的隐式CoT方法存在语义对齐问题和生成效率问题。

Method: 设计了对比训练的句子转换器来评估隐式和显式推理之间的语义对齐，并引入了通过知识蒸馏微调的轻量级语言模型作为高效的隐式推理生成器。

Result: 大量实验表明，SemCoT在效率和效果上都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化token级生成速度和保持语义对齐来增强CoT效率的方法，在效率和有效性方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现不同架构、数据集和规模的自回归语言模型在预训练过程中表现出高度一致的行为模式，98%的词级行为方差可由三个简单启发式解释：词频、n-gram概率和语义相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化模式是否具有一致性，以及这些变化是否可由简单统计特征解释。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在11万+英语token上的行为，比较了Transformer、Mamba、RWKV等不同架构，OpenWebText和The Pile等不同数据集，以及1400万到120亿参数的不同规模模型。

Result: 发现所有语言模型都表现出相似的行为阶段：在训练过程中，模型对词的预测概率会逐渐过拟合到这些词的n-gram概率，且n值随训练增加。三个简单启发式（词频、n-gram概率、语义相似度）可解释高达98%的词级行为方差。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习轨迹可能独立于模型具体细节，遵循相似的规律，这为理解语言模型学习机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

TL;DR: POWSM是首个统一的语音模型框架，能够联合执行多种音素相关任务，包括语音识别、音素识别、字素到音素转换和音素到字素转换，在保持性能的同时实现了任务统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音素相关任务在概念上相似，但现有研究通常孤立处理，使用特定架构和数据集。作者希望开发一个统一框架来联合处理这些任务。

Method: 提出了POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model），这是一个能够联合执行多种音素相关任务的统一框架，支持音频、文本和音素之间的无缝转换。

Result: POWSM在相似规模下优于或匹配专门的音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，作者发布了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，需要研究简化模型中的可解释计算电路

Method: 从头训练小型注意力变换器，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制

Result: 单层双头模型在IOI任务上达到完美准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路；双层单头模型通过跨层组合也能达到类似性能

Conclusion: 任务特定训练可诱导高度可解释的最小电路，为研究变换器推理的计算基础提供了受控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征，表明文本相关表征在模型中占据主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着口语语言模型的发展，需要评估它们是否真正整合了音频和文本模态，以及其泛化能力如何。本文通过情感不一致的语音样本来测试模型对音频和文本的整合程度。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音数据集（EMIS），其中语义内容和语音表达性传达不同的情感，评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的表现。

Result: 结果表明口语语言模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感来完成任务，文本相关表征在很大程度上主导了音频表征。

Conclusion: 当前的口语语言模型在情感识别任务中未能充分整合音频模态，文本表征占据主导地位，需要进一步改进模型的跨模态整合能力。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于识别未知领域，但现有研究主要关注显性知识空白检测，需要扩展至更复杂的隐性知识空白推断任务。

Method: 在四个数据集上对近1500份文档进行实验，比较闭源模型（OpenAI）和开源模型（Llama、Gemma 2），引入TABI推理方案结构化推理过程并验证推断结论。

Result: LLMs在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面表现出强大能力，开源和闭源模型均表现良好，较大模型通常表现更佳。

Conclusion: LLMs能够系统识别候选知识空白，支持早期研究制定、政策制定和资助决策，但需要领域适应、人机验证等稳健部署措施。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)能否评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，结果表明LLMs可以近似估计认知复杂度，但在元认知意识方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度依赖人工标注，现有NLP工具难以提取推理过程中的认知特征，因此研究LLMs是否能够自动估计这些认知特征。

Method: 通过分析证据范围和转换水平两个认知维度，使用LLMs来估计阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，并与人类标注结果进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似估计题目的认知复杂度，表明其具有作为先验难度分析工具的潜力。但LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识存在差距，即使给出正确答案，有时也无法正确识别其推理过程的特征。

Conclusion: LLMs在评估阅读理解题目认知复杂度方面具有潜力，但在元认知意识方面仍需改进，这为开发更智能的教育评估工具提供了方向。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽视了语言的多维结构，需要开发能够处理多维语义极性的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调优的UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量来构建极性场。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示，TOPol能够一致地捕捉情感和非情感的极性转变，结果对主要人类可调参数敏感，确认了方法的稳定性。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化和可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的指代消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式高度模糊、长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估生成式LLM在此领域的适用性。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计了四种不同的提示实验，包括局部上下文增强和领域特定线索（如缩写和实体词典），并与SpanBERT进行对比分析。

Result: LLMs展现出强大的表层指代能力，特别是在使用领域基础提示时表现更好，但性能仍对长距离上下文和指称模糊性敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下显示出优越的精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程有潜力增强LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，特别是在结合领域特定知识时能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模社交互动中的观点变化对解决错误信息和极化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的动态，缺乏衡量真实人类观点轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含来自2,792名美国参与者关于107个争议话题的多轮辩论对话，同时收集公开表达的消息和私下报告的观点。使用该基准系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调使LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 发现模拟与真实群体动态存在关键差异。通过监督微调在表面指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得改进，但在更深层次的语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究突出了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性，为改进多智能体交互的真实性提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Motivation: 旨在解决低资源语言机器翻译性能与高资源语言之间的差距，为边缘化社区和代表性不足群体开发更包容、准确的NLP模型。

Method: 基于Reid和Artetxe (2021)的方法，探索多种预训练策略，包括多语言集成以及在预训练阶段同时使用单语和平行数据。

Result: 多语言预训练和结合单语与平行数据能显著提升低资源语言的翻译质量。

Conclusion: 本研究为低资源机器翻译提供了有效的预训练策略见解，有助于缩小高低资源语言之间的性能差距，促进更包容的NLP模型发展。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Result: 提供了大语言模型遗忘领域的全面概述，包括方法分类、评估框架和实用指南，帮助研究人员更好地理解和应用遗忘技术。

Conclusion: 大语言模型遗忘是确保模型安全可靠的关键技术，本综述为该领域的持续发展提供了信息指导和方向建议。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声的方法，通过端到端模型分离干净的语音代码本标记，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，显著提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在嘈杂或真实环境中的表现并不总是最优。现有方法在量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模时，未能有效分离语义内容和背景噪声。

Method: 在Whisper嵌入的基础上，提出端到端模型在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声。模型分离出干净的语音代码本标记，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，并通过轻量级分类器进行监督。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper实现了82%的错误率降低，相比基线方法提升了35%的性能。学习到的标记空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了噪声环境下语音与文本的对齐质量，生成的语音标记具有高度的噪声不变性，显著改善了自动语音识别性能，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [31] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转化为LLM可消费的知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种路径，并通过MDP-Agent实现该协议，在信息检索基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI搜索中，网页、PDF等原始文档不适合LLM直接使用，它们冗长、嘈杂且非结构化。传统检索方法返回原始片段，将片段组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM，需要新的检索范式重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: 提出Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，通过三种路径将非结构化文档转化为任务特定的LLM就绪输入：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记以丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。通过MDP-Agent实现该协议，包括构建文档级要点记忆、基于扩散的探索与垂直开发、以及map-reduce风格合成。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例化的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架重新定义了模型与文档的交互方式，通过将原始文档转化为紧凑、结构化的知识表示，显著提升了LLM的推理效率，为AI搜索提供了新的检索范式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [32] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究测试了大语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，发现模型在英语等高资源语言上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语和豪萨语等低资源语言上性能显著下降。链式思维提示对能力较弱的模型有帮助，但对强模型可能产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型的优异表现是源于真实能力还是仅仅因为英语数据的优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试模型来验证。

Method: 基于Next Sentence Prediction任务，创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语各10,000个问题的大规模基准，测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入链式思维提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上急剧下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。链式思维提示对LLaMA 3有帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini可能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 链式思维提示并非通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型的基线能力和任务的具体背景。该框架能识别LLM的弱点，揭示链式思维在跨语言NSP任务中的帮助或阻碍作用，以及影响其决策的因素。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate是首个评估主动AI调解代理在复杂多议题多方谈判中的框架，包含模拟测试平台和社会认知评估指标，证明社交智能调解代理优于通用基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估主动AI代理在多方协作中的系统方法，而谈判作为需要社会认知智能的挑战性测试平台，需要AI能够管理多方利益冲突并建立共识。

Method: ProMediate包含两个核心组件：基于现实谈判案例和理论驱动难度级别的模拟测试平台，以及包含共识变化、干预延迟、调解效果等新指标的社会认知评估框架。

Result: 在ProMediate-Hard设置中，社交调解代理比通用基线的共识变化提高3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度快77%（15.98s vs 3.71s）。

Conclusion: ProMediate为开发主动、社交智能代理提供了一个严谨、理论基础的测试平台。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 低资源语言的领域特定问答面临两个关键挑战：标注数据集稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限

Method: 使用大型LLM生成合成问答对来增强有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法并分析其对领域泛化的影响

Result: 大型模型能高效生成合成数据，小型模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展路径

Conclusion: 多阶段微调结合合成数据增强是解决低资源领域问答问题的有效方法

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD是一个统一框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型中提取知识来增强参数高效微调方法，在少样本场景下显著提升多模态讽刺检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源环境下具有挑战性，因为图像-文本间的微妙矛盾难以从稀缺的标注数据中学习。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然减少过拟合，但由于少样本数据的有限监督而难以达到最优性能。

Method: 提出PEKD框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型进行知识蒸馏来增强PEFT方法。引入基于熵的门控机制，根据教师模型的置信度动态调整蒸馏强度，以缓解不可靠信号的影响。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法在少样本场景下超越了先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: PEKD是一个模块化且适应性强的框架，可广泛应用于各种多模态模型和任务，有效解决了低资源环境下多模态讽刺检测的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Parrot训练框架，通过整合自然语言思维链和程序思维链两种范式实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常单向增强N-CoT或P-CoT，本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势实现相互增强和同步改进

Method: 1) 设计三个目标导向的子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可迁移性；3) 设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题

Result: 实验表明Parror显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提升了+21.87和+21.48

Conclusion: Parrot框架成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT两种范式的相互增强，为数学推理任务提供了有效的训练方法

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Motivation: 解决商业智能代理在复杂数据关系和多样化任务（从统计查询到知识问答）中的挑战，提升其在真实业务场景中的表现。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和基于强化学习的训练范式，使模型适应复杂业务环境；在推理时引入共享记忆机制，让代理从类似问题的任务指南中学习。

Conclusion: CRMWeaver方法有效提升了商业代理在复杂环境中的性能和泛化能力，特别在未见场景中表现突出，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对将大语言模型用于法律解释，发现模型在不同问题格式下会得出截然不同的结论，且与人类判断相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期有学者和联邦法官提议将大语言模型加入法律解释工具包的做法，本文旨在通过实证研究验证这种做法的可行性。

Method: 在英语环境下进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型的稳定性，并比较模型输出与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，不同问题格式会导致模型得出截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断仅存在弱到中等程度的相关性，且不同模型和问题变体间存在巨大差异。

Conclusion: 对生成式AI得出的结论给予过多信任是危险的，大语言模型目前不适合用于法律解释实践。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Motivation: 研究小规模语言模型是否能够从人类启发的学习策略（指令调优）中获益，特别是在资源受限的情况下。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的仅解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种方式，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中带来小幅但一致的增益，顺序课程优于合并数据；但改进不持续转移到零样本任务，表明交互聚焦适应与广泛语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在低资源语言模型中采用人类启发学习策略的潜力和限制，并指向混合、基于课程的方法来在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文献推荐中产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，研究引用频率如何影响生成参考文献的准确性。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过余弦相似度比较生成与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 发现：(i)不同研究领域的幻觉率不同；(ii)引用次数与事实准确性强相关；(iii)超过约1000次引用的文献几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文在模型中被几乎逐字保留，表明存在从泛化到记忆的转变阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: 提出SQPsych框架，使用LLM生成基于结构化心理问卷的合成心理咨询对话，解决心理健康AI因隐私限制缺乏真实治疗对话数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于缺乏真实的治疗对话数据，主要原因是严格的隐私法规和历史上很少记录临床会话。

Method: 基于认知行为疗法原则，开发SQPsych框架，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源LLM生成高质量语料库。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越基线模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据有潜力实现可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的心理健康AI支持。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要是以英语为中心和领域无关的，限制了其在印度语境下的适用性，需要针对印度文化和领域的特定评估。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的基准数据集，其中52,494个英文和21,672个印地语，来源于真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域90+子领域500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs显示显著的领域和语言性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率76.49%，但在阿育吠陀仅59.74%。所有模型在英文内容上表现均优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域的能力提供了全面数据集，支持领域知识与双语理解的整合评估，所有资源公开可用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了名为Symphony的新型LLM服务系统架构，通过服务程序而非提示词来解决现有系统效率低下和适应性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法高效适应日益复杂的LLM应用，设计不够灵活。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序(LIPs)概念，允许用户运行时自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，将部分应用逻辑(如工具执行)卸载到服务器。Symphony作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，用专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统架构能够更高效和可扩展地服务LLM应用。

Conclusion: Symphony有潜力为LLM应用开启更高效和可扩展的生态系统。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)自动标注和过滤手语数据的框架，显著减少人工标注依赖，应用于TikTok视频构建多语言手语数据集TikTok-SL-8。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、多语言覆盖不足，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。VLMs作为评估器和实时助手的能力未被充分用于手语数据采集。

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频文本提取、视频-文本对齐验证等通用过滤、标注和验证步骤，应用于TikTok八种手语视频和YouTube-SL-25德语手语数据集。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8多语言手语语料库，在德语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型，建立了自动提取的噪声数据上的基准性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展的弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型理解隐含意义的能力及其对提升人机交互质量的影响，发现理解隐含意义能显著改善模型响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人机交互中日益重要，需要关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义（通过共享上下文传达的言外之意），这对人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究评估了不同规模LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并检验理解隐含意义是否能改善响应生成。

Result: 结果显示，较大模型更接近人类理解，而较小模型在隐含意义推断上表现较差。基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了所有模型响应的相关性和质量，特别是对小模型提升明显。67.6%的参与者更喜欢隐含意义提示生成的响应。

Conclusion: 研究表明语言学理论可用于解决对齐问题，使人机交互更加自然和基于上下文，理解隐含意义能显著改善人机交互质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对神经定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，专注于真实世界Lean形式化项目中的研究级数学问题，揭示了现有模型在真实研究场景中的表现差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在精选基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限，需要更真实的评估环境。

Method: 通过利用真实的Lean Blueprint形式化项目，创建包含6个Lean项目中613个定理的评估套件，专注于挑战性的研究级定理。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有最先进模型仅达到10.3%的通过率，表明在现有基准测试上的进展难以转化到这些更真实的设置中。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask框架通过利用专家轨迹的"观察未来"来学习主动对话代理，无需用户模拟器，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，在真实医疗数据上验证有效，并在在线服务中部署成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱、高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"。

Method: 利用专家轨迹的观察未来推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化(action, state_assessment)元组，控制询问内容和停止时机，并通过自动评分器校准确保奖励保真度。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了Learn-to-Ask的有效性，使用高达32B的LLM，成功部署到大规模在线AI服务中，内部评估显示性能甚至优于人类专家。

Conclusion: 该框架为将被动LLM转化为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为实际现实世界影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，将LLM在定性研究中的应用按解释深度和自主性两个维度分类，建议通过分解任务、限制自主性来平衡效率与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具的社科论文，构建了按解释深度和自主性分类的框架，建议将任务分解为可管理部分。

Result: 开发了一个实用框架，帮助研究人员在保持透明度和可靠性的同时有效利用LLM。

Conclusion: 通过限制LLM自主性、选择性增加解释深度并在监督下使用，可以在保持研究质量的同时获得LLM的效率优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合微调大语言模型和命名实体识别的管道，用于高效的领域特定文本摘要和标记，特别针对快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战，需要能够适应新兴语言趋势的高效文本处理方案。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架对LLMs进行微调，包括通用和定制领域特定数据集（特别是政治和安全领域），结合命名实体识别技术。

Result: 指令微调显著提高了摘要和标记的准确性，LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后超越了中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 该管道能够生成简洁摘要和结构化实体标记，支持实时应用，为现代知识管理和安全操作提供了将非结构化文本转化为可操作见解的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: 本文分析了手语翻译(SLT)自动评估指标的局限性，发现基于文本的指标如BLEU、ROUGE等在手语翻译评估中存在不足，而基于大语言模型的评估器虽然能更好地捕捉语义等价性，但对LLM重写的翻译存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖基于文本的指标如BLEU和ROUGE，但这些指标是否能可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确，需要系统分析其局限性。

Method: 通过分析六种评估指标，包括BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及基于大语言模型的评估器G-Eval和GEMBA，在三种控制条件下评估其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出中的幻觉以及句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在明显局限性，基于LLM的评估器能更好地捕捉语义等价性，但对LLM重写的翻译存在偏见。所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，而BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例相对宽容。

Conclusion: 需要超越基于文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体研究主要关注单个智能体的行动规划，而智能体间协作完成共同目标的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器框架，为LLM智能体配备不同通信策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题游戏中测试协作能力。

Result: 实验结果表明对齐的通信至关重要，无通信的智能体也能达到高任务完成率，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类信任；通过环境验证器可增强规则理解和任务完成能力。

Conclusion: 集成环境验证器能提升智能体对任务规则的理解和任务完成能力，促进AI系统中更安全、可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Motivation: 大型语言模型在宗教问答等高风险专业领域存在幻觉问题，现有RAG系统无法处理需要多步推理的复杂查询，波斯语穆斯林社区对准确性和可信度有极高要求。

Method: 采用FAIR-RAG架构：一个忠实、自适应、迭代优化的RAG框架，通过动态自校正过程分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，并迭代生成子查询来填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现优异：负面拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确率达到74.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为波斯伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构对于在敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的关键作用。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估语言模型推理效率的框架，通过逻辑编程对齐自然语言证明与最短证明，量化模型避免不必要推理的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估过于关注正确性而忽视效率，而真实推理场景中大量信息是无关的，有效推理需要识别和忽略这些干扰。

Method: 提出基于逻辑编程的评估框架，将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序执行找到的最短证明对齐，量化推理效率。构建包含无关公理的数学应用题数据集进行实证研究。

Result: 当前语言模型在包含无关信息的条件下准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能，生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要改进其识别和忽略无关信息的能力以实现更高效的人类式推理。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的人物模拟评估存在局限：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、缺少能力需求分析。为解决这些问题，需要开发更全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达），并将LLM性能评估分解为六项基本能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、人物语调和句法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物模拟方面达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基准。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在人物模拟方面取得进展，但在某些关键能力上仍有明显差距，需要进一步改进才能达到人类水平的模拟效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言代理的基准测试，涵盖32个软件应用和604个工具，提供多样化的应用、真实的环境设置和可靠的执行评估，旨在推动现实世界中长时程复杂任务的语言代理发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理基准测试往往局限于狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估代理在现实世界中处理复杂多步骤工作流程所需的多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性。

Method: 基于高质量MCP服务器集构建，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个手动收集或设计的任务，平均需要约20轮交互才能完成，每个任务都通过专用评估脚本严格验证。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进模型表现不佳：最佳模型Claude-4.5-Sonnet成功率仅38.6%，平均需要20.2次工具调用；最佳开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp成功率仅20.1%。

Conclusion: Toolathlon基准测试将推动开发更强大的语言代理，以应对现实世界中的长时程任务执行挑战。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明说服性提示能够显著增强从故意遗忘的大语言模型中恢复事实知识的能力，效果与模型大小成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型遗忘效果的挑战，需要有效方法来测试遗忘模型的完整性。

Method: 提出SKeB框架，基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论，通过领域图和说服性提示测试知识激活模式。

Result: 说服性提示大幅提升事实知识恢复率（从14.8%到24.5%），模型越小恢复效果越好（2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估LLM遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前智能体评估过于关注一次性任务完成，忽视了现实问题中迭代协作的本质，人类目标往往不明确且不断演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析智能体在多轮真实场景中的表现。

Result: 研究表明最先进的智能体在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持用户参与和搭建理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断智能体行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然测试时缩放技术在数学和编程等正式领域已被证明有效，但其在法律等论证性领域的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用7个奖励模型家族，在五个法律MCQA基准上评估结果级(Best-of-N)和过程级(树搜索)验证方法，重点关注低预算条件下的性能。

Result: 系统分析了验证器效用的关键影响因素，包括领域专业化、模型规模、监督类型(过程监督PRMs vs 结果监督ORMs)以及跨角色应用效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为测试时缩放技术在法律论证领域的应用提供了实证基础，揭示了验证器设计的关键因素对性能的影响。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: Gaperon是一个完全开源的法国-英语-编程语言模型套件，包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练数据达2-4万亿token，并公开了完整的训练流水线。研究发现数据过滤与测试集污染之间存在复杂关系，并探讨了基准测试泄漏问题。


<details>

Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，建立多语言语言模型开发中数据管理、评估、安全性和开放性之间权衡的研究基础。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法英数据集，开发高效的数据整理和训练框架，发布数百个中间检查点，并在预训练中引入无害数据中毒。

Result: 语言质量过滤能提升文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染（在包含测试集的数据上继续训练）能恢复竞争性分数，仅适度损害生成质量。

Conclusion: Gaperon为探索多语言语言模型开发中的数据管理、评估、安全性和开放性权衡提供了可复现的基础，揭示了数据过滤与基准测试性能之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 提出了EHR-Ins数据集、EHR-R1模型和EHR-Bench基准，显著提升了电子健康记录分析的可靠性和临床相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在分析EHR时存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的限制。

Method: 使用思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量推理数据，开发EHR-R1系列模型，采用领域适应、推理增强和强化学习的多阶段训练范式。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上比GPT-4o高出30多分，在EHRSHOT上实现了10%更高的零样本AUROC，持续优于最先进的商业和开源LLM。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时处理理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习过程中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；为每个生成样本检索语义相关的理解示例形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO算法根据配对相似度调整优势函数。

Result: 构建了包含16K理解-生成对的高质量数据集PairUG，在强大的Janus-Pro UVLMs上评估，相比强基线实现了平衡的改进。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据配对和相应的优化对齐，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解与生成任务的平衡问题，在各种UVLM上实现了平衡的性能提升。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLM作为结构化表格数据分类任务的替代方案，特别是在高风险金融应用中的适用性。

Method: 在真实世界贷款违约预测任务上，系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM的性能，使用SHAP分析特征归因，评估LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，自解释与实证SHAP归因经常不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为独立模型在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，其自解释的可信度存在问题，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这推迟了推理到训练后阶段，且未充分利用预训练数据。作者希望通过将推理构建到预训练阶段来改进这一局限。

Method: 提出循环语言模型（LoopLM），采用三种关键技术：(i) 潜在空间中的迭代计算，(ii) 用于学习深度分配的熵正则化目标，(iii) 扩展到7.7T tokens的大规模预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现出色，性能匹配高达12B参数的SOTA LLM。实验表明这种优势源于更优越的知识操作能力而非知识容量增加。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型作为推理时代的新扩展方向具有巨大潜力，能够产生比显式思维链更与最终输出对齐的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Conclusion: DiagramEval为LLM生成的演示图提供了有效的评估框架，通过图结构建模和新的对齐指标，实现了对图表质量的量化评估和深入分析。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Conclusion: 将归因重构为推理问题，通过答案分解作为中间步骤，能够有效提升复杂问答任务中的归因可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖基于路径的指标来排序查询，忽略了查询的推理树结构

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)度量查询学习难度，基于r-score提出推理树调度算法(Re-Schedule)，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上的实验显示，Re-Schedule显著提高了平均准确率，最高提升达3.2%

Conclusion: 推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确说明

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProFees框架，使用LLM自动化医疗评估与管理(E/M)编码，解决了真实世界的复杂性，在专家标注数据集上比商业系统提升了36%以上的编码准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生的文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理质量。但现实世界的复杂性使得这项任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了ProFees框架，基于LLM来处理E/M编码任务，解决了现实世界中的关键复杂性。

Result: 在专家标注的真实世界数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统提高了36%以上的编码准确率，比最强的单提示基线提高了近5%。

Conclusion: ProFees框架在解决现实世界复杂性方面表现出有效性，能够显著提升E/M编码的准确性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过显式状态跟踪和占位符后处理，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中无法遵循规则流程的问题，实现99%以上的状态合规性和计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在游戏交互中缺乏对规则治理交易系统（浏览-报价-审查-确认）基本流程的遵循，损害玩家信任。需要解决LLM的创造性灵活性与游戏交易程序性需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM显式化其状态跟踪过程，要求模型识别并报告前一轮的预定义状态标签。配合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，状态合规性>99%，计算精度达99.3%。小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)通过ASTP和占位符后处理可达到大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)的性能，同时响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP为商业游戏建立了实用基础，既能满足实时性要求，又能适应资源约束，在保持LLM创造性的同时确保交易系统的程序完整性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练方法主要关注结果导向的奖励机制，缺乏对推理过程的考量，限制了大型推理模型的多步推理能力发展。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算标量一致性奖励，衡量策略模型的推理过程与预训练教师模型的匹配程度，结合标准答案/格式奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的基于GRPO的后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘实现推理感知的GRPO能够有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个基于多阶段课程强化学习的KBQA模型，通过结果监督训练LLM在知识库上进行自主推理，显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督微调LLM，但这种方法探索激励不足，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习：首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL，缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA零样本子集上相对提升达11.1%，且仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于结果监督的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理能力，证明了多阶段课程RL在增强KBQA代理推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法通常作为静态层应用于输入或输出，仅提供二元分类（安全或不安全），缺乏动态性和可解释性。

Method: 引入Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector四个协作智能体，构建动态、合作的智能体系统进行上下文感知审核。

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不遵循率。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过利用智能体架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了智能体系统作为自动安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶技术虽然带来诸多好处，但计算引擎的高能耗限制了电动汽车的续航里程。感知计算作为最耗电的组件，现有压缩技术往往导致模型尺寸过大或精度显著下降。

Method: 提出EneAD框架：1）自适应感知模块：管理多个不同计算消耗的感知模型，动态调整执行帧率；使用贝叶斯优化进行可转移调优；2）鲁棒决策模块：基于强化学习的决策模型，设计正则化项增强驾驶稳定性。

Conclusion: EneAD框架通过自适应感知和鲁棒决策，有效解决了自动驾驶中的能耗问题，在保持感知精度的同时显著提升了能源效率。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAVR框架，通过利用答案来引导LLM生成高质量推理路径，解决了在LLM能力范围之外的任务中难以采样有效推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，发现"为什么这是答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为前者避免了开放式探索的认知负担，而是进行解释性重建。LLM同样可以利用答案来推导高质量推理路径。

Method: 引入RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过条件化答案来提高采样推理路径的期望效用。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线方法展现出持续改进，减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 条件化答案能够将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，RAVR框架通过答案引导的推理有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Motivation: 工业事件日志数据复杂且异构，现有自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化、适应性不足等问题，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用多代理系统（想法代理、代码代理、批评代理、评估代理）结合强化学习和遗传算法原理，通过协作生成、验证和实施特征想法，并利用知识库和双记忆系统实现持续改进。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能并减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统有望成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体方法（如ReAct）采用顺序推理执行，无法利用独立子任务间的并行性，导致工具使用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练智能体基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定可并行执行的工具和必须顺序执行的依赖关系。采用两阶段训练策略：先在高质量数据集上进行监督微调，然后通过基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上表现突出，通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Conclusion: 图基规划框架能够有效解决顺序推理的瓶颈问题，通过依赖感知的并行执行策略，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提升执行效率。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT是一种改进的MCTS抽象算法，通过推断状态-动作对之间的价值差异来分组，相比OGA-UCT能检测到更多抽象，提高样本效率，在多种确定性环境中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS抽象算法OGA-UCT要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，从而影响了样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，打破价值等价分组的范式，允许分组具有不同价值的状态-动作对，只要它们的价值差异可以被推断。KVDA-UCT通过分析即时奖励来推断价值差异，并修改OGA-UCT使用该框架。

Result: KVDA-UCT比OGA-UCT检测到显著更多的抽象，没有引入额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异来分组状态-动作对，比严格的价值等价分组更有效，能显著提高MCTS的样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

### [82] [Instrumental goals in advanced AI systems: Features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471)
*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将AI系统中的工具性目标视为需要接受和管理的特征，而非需要限制的故障，主张基于亚里士多德本体论来理解和管理这些目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险来源，试图限制其症状，但本文认为这种观点可能过于狭隘。

Result: 论证了工具性倾向是AI系统构成的本质结果而非偶然故障，提出了新的理解框架。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更侧重于理解、管理和引导工具性目标，而非试图消除它们。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性，从而提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤无缝集成数据库执行反馈。扩展了GRPO算法以适应复杂多轮交互场景，并添加了轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过多轮工具集成推理和动态反馈机制，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了动态执行反馈在复杂SQL生成任务中的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在解决逻辑规则中谓词命名问题上展现出应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: 提出的零强化学习范式能够有效提升语言模型在可验证和不可验证领域的推理能力，并实现推理能力在不同领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AAW系统的高度自主性和广泛应用，需要深入理解其运作机制，但目前缺乏评估单个代理对最终输出影响的方法。

Method: 提出Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR)方法，通过反事实分析来评估每个代理对AAW输出的影响力，确定最具影响力的代理。

Result: 在包含30个不同用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估AAW中代理影响力的方法，提供任务无关的分析能力，可用于离线和推理时分析。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个基于强化学习的多轮交互框架，通过微调视觉语言模型，使其能够主动导航和理解长篇视觉丰富的文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理长篇复杂文档时表现不佳，主要因为固定推理模板和刚性流程限制了模型的主动性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ALDEN框架，包含页面索引访问的fetch动作、基于规则的跨级别奖励机制，以及视觉语义锚定机制来稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个开源数据集上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向自主导航和推理的转变，为更准确高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法将检索块独立处理，难以处理多跳或关系推理，特别是跨文档的情况。知识图谱虽然能通过三元组捕获实体关系，但会遗漏不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 提出BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上添加基于频率的权重，反映链接强度，借鉴赫布原理的"一起激活，一起连接"思想。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现提升，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权的非三元组边有效改善了知识图谱的信息捕获能力，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Motivation: 现有心理咨询LLM方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和跨会话治疗方法的长期记忆，与真实临床实践差距较大。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了该架构在心理咨询中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.
