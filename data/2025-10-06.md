### [1] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的优势直接融入模型权重，使LLM能够区分已知和未知问题，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而非承认无知。现有激活引导方法需要实时监控和干预，缺乏实用性。

Method: 提出CASAL算法，将可解释性与摊销优化相结合，仅训练单个Transformer层的子模块，将激活引导效果固化到模型权重中。

Result: 在多个短问答基准测试中减少30%-40%的幻觉，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，在OOD领域也有效泛化。

Conclusion: CASAL是首个对密集和MoE模型都有效的基于引导的训练方法，为可解释性方法在实际部署中应用迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

### [2] [Hallucination-Resistant, Domain-Specific Research Assistant with Self-Evaluation and Vector-Grounded Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02326)
*Vivek Bhavsar,Joseph Ereifej,Aravanan Gurusami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的模块化研究助手，使用有限状态机控制循环（相关性→置信度→知识）来减少幻觉和错误引用，通过向量检索和确定性引用管道提供可靠的技术文献分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文献综述中能加速工作但存在幻觉和错误引用问题，限制了在专家工作流程中的实用性，需要开发更可靠的AI研究助手。

Method: 采用有限状态机控制循环，包含相关性过滤、置信度评分、问题分解和按需检索，结合向量检索和确定性引用管道，构建领域知识库并实现分级数据摄取。

Result: 在光子学领域的评估中，专家盲测显示RA-FSM优于Notebook LM和标准GPT API，具有更好的边界条件处理和证据使用能力，同时保持可调的延迟和成本开销。

Conclusion: RA-FSM设计强调透明、充分引用的答案，适用于高风险技术工作，并可推广到其他科学领域。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

### [3] [KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02327)
*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，结合了实时语音到语音模型和大型语言模型的优势，在保持低延迟的同时提升语义理解和知识表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时语音对话系统中，S2S模型缺乏深度知识理解，而级联系统虽然知识丰富但延迟过高的问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：S2S变换器处理用户语音实现即时响应，同时将查询传递给后端LLM，LLM的文本响应实时指导S2S模型的语音生成。

Result: 在MT-Bench语音合成基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功弥合了实时S2S模型和知识丰富级联系统之间的差距，实现了低延迟和高知识表达能力的平衡。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

### [4] [AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328)
*Ziqing Wang,Chengsheng Mao,Xiaole Wen,Yuan Luo,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AMANDA框架，通过LLM代理进行医学知识增强，解决医学多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下的推理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-MLLMs在低资源环境下存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈无法整合专业医学知识。

Method: 使用训练免费的代理框架，通过内在医学知识增强（粗到细问题分解）和外在医学知识增强（生物医学知识图谱检索）来增强推理能力。

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和少样本设置下都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了医学多模态大语言模型的推理瓶颈，在低资源医学视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

### [5] [SelfJudge: Faster Speculative Decoding via Self-Supervised Judge Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02329)
*Kanghoon Yoon,Minsub Kim,Sungjae Lee,Joonhyung Lee,Sunghyeon Woo,Yeonjun In,Se Jung Kwon,Chanyoung Park,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过自监督训练验证器来加速LLM推理，通过评估语义保留来放宽验证标准，在多种NLP任务上实现更好的推理速度-准确性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的judge解码方法依赖人工标注或可验证真实值的任务，限制了在不同NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过目标模型的自监督训练验证器，通过评估替换标记后的响应是否保留原始含义来衡量语义保留，实现跨任务的自动验证器训练。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理速度与准确性权衡方面优于judge解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为更快的LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

### [6] [EntropyLong: Effective Long-Context Training via Predictive Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02330)
*Junlong Jia,Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Chaochen Gao,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu,Binghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EntropyLong方法，利用预测不确定性验证长距离依赖关系质量，通过识别高熵位置、检索相关上下文并验证其信息增益，构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文语言模型训练方法（如文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法来捕获长范围依赖。

Method: 使用模型内循环验证：识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证其效用，构建包含原始文档和已验证上下文补充的训练样本。

Result: 在FineWebEdu和Cosmopedia上生成了128K长度序列的数据集，训练模型在RULER基准测试中显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上。指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得重大进展。

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，能够确保依赖关系代表可测量的信息增益而非虚假相关性。

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

### [7] [Synthetic Dialogue Generation for Interactive Conversational Elicitation & Recommendation (ICER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02331)
*Moonkyung Ryu,Chih-Wei Hsu,Yinlam Chow,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用行为模拟器和语言模型提示生成与用户潜在状态一致的自然对话的方法，用于解决对话推荐系统数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在对话推荐系统中具有巨大潜力，但公开的CRS数据稀缺使得微调语言模型变得困难。现有的用户模拟器作为数据生成器往往缺乏行为一致性。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，生成与用户潜在状态一致的自然对话。通过这种方法生成了包含偏好获取和示例批评的大规模开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量、行为一致的对话数据，为训练基于语言模型的对话推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

### [8] [A High-Capacity and Secure Disambiguation Algorithm for Neural Linguistic Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02332)
*Yapei Feng,Feng Jiang,Shanhao Wu,Hua Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为look-ahead Sync的新方法，解决了神经语言隐写中因分词歧义导致的容量限制问题，在保持可证明安全性的同时显著提高了嵌入容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法SyncPool通过粗粒度同步机制解决分词歧义问题，但牺牲了嵌入容量，将整个歧义组的香农熵仅用于同步而非有效载荷嵌入。

Method: look-ahead Sync方法仅在真正不可区分的token序列上执行最小同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量。

Result: 在英语（Llama 3）和中文（Qwen 2.5）基准测试中，该方法始终接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool，英语嵌入率提升超过160%，中文提升超过25%。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

### [9] [Human Mobility Datasets Enriched With Contextual and Social Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02333)
*Chiara Pugliese,Francesco Lettich,Guido Rocchietti,Chiara Renso,Fabio Pinelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个包含语义增强的人类轨迹数据集，包含GPS轨迹、停留点、移动、POI、交通方式、天气数据和LLM生成的社交媒体帖子，支持语义推理和FAIR数据实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了支持多模态和语义移动性分析，需要结合真实世界移动数据、结构化语义增强、LLM生成文本和语义网兼容性的可重用框架。

Method: 从OpenStreetMap获取公开GPS轨迹，构建包含上下文层（停留、移动、POI、交通方式、天气）和LLM生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，提供表格和RDF格式。

Result: 创建了巴黎和纽约两个大型城市的数据集，提供开源可复现的流水线，支持行为建模、移动预测、知识图谱构建和LLM应用等研究任务。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合真实世界移动、结构化语义增强、LLM生成文本和语义网兼容性的可重用资源框架，为移动性研究提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

### [10] [Where Did It Go Wrong? Attributing Undesirable LLM Behaviors via Representation Gradient Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02334)
*Zhe Li,Wei Zhao,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表示和梯度的新框架，用于诊断LLM中的不良行为，包括有害内容、后门攻击和知识污染等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参数梯度的归因方法存在噪声信号大和计算复杂的问题，难以有效诊断LLM不良行为的根本原因。

Method: 在模型激活空间中直接操作，分析表示及其梯度，提供语义上有意义的信号来连接输出与训练数据。

Result: 该方法在样本级归因方面表现优异，同时支持细粒度的token级分析，能精确识别影响模型行为的特定样本和短语。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解、审计和减轻LLM相关风险提供了一个强大的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is
available at https://github.com/plumprc/RepT.

### [11] [FormalML: A Benchmark for Evaluating Formal Subgoal Completion in Machine Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02335)
*Xiao-Wen Yang,Zihao Zhang,Jianuo Cao,Zhi Zhou,Zenan Li,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yuan Yao,Taolue Chen,Yu-Feng Li,Xiaoxing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了FormalML基准，用于评估LLM在数学证明子目标补全任务中的能力，发现现有证明器在准确性和效率方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为数学家助手填补复杂证明中缺失步骤的潜力，研究子目标补全任务。

Method: 引入FormalML基准，使用Lean 4构建，通过翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式，提取4937个优化和概率不等式问题。

Result: 评估最先进的证明器显示在准确性和效率方面存在持续限制。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似度资源，但低资源语言如库尔德语仍然缺乏相关数据集和基准。

Method: 创建了10,000个库尔德语句子对数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语域，每个句子对都标注了相似度。使用Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等强基线模型进行基准测试。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时凸显了库尔德语形态学、正字法变异和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线为库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP的未来研究提供了可复现的评估套件和强有力起点。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，用于评估机器生成文本在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估方法多为单一分数，缺乏对文本多个维度的细致分析。CRACQ旨在提供更全面、可解释的评估方法。

Method: 基于特质自动作文评分方法，扩展到多种机器生成文本，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估。在500个合成资助提案上训练。

Result: 与LLM作为评判者相比，CRACQ产生更稳定和可解释的特质级别判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ为机器生成文本提供了更细致和可解释的评估框架，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展应用领域。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

### [14] [Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02338)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合GRPO强化学习和DocLens评估器的临床文档生成框架，直接优化事实准确性和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档生成需要与完整性、事实准确性等优先级精确对齐，现有方法存在依赖人工参考或单独奖励模型的问题。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合DocLens评估器，DocLens提供基于对话的确定性奖励，通过简单的奖励门控策略降低训练成本。

Result: 该方法提高了临床笔记质量，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面更受偏好，减少了遗漏和幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至实际应用场景，并能整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，改进效果可能是保守的下界估计。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

*Kevin Zhou,Adam Dejl,Gabriel Freedman,Lihu Chen,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在基于计算论证的可解释LLM框架（ArgLLMs）中集成不确定性量化方法，通过声明验证任务评估不同UQ方法的有效性，发现直接提示法虽然简单但效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的重要性日益增长，确保其可靠性变得至关重要。不确定性量化是保证这项突破性技术可靠性的关键环节，特别是在基于论证的决策框架中。

Method: 在论证性LLM框架中集成不同的LLM不确定性量化方法，通过声明验证任务进行实验评估，比较不同UQ方法的性能表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管直接提示法很简单，但在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，表现明显优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 直接提示法作为不确定性量化策略在论证性LLM框架中具有显著优势，为评估UQ方法有效性提供了一种新颖的实验方法，特别适用于处理复杂和有争议的陈述。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ

*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过提示技术让大语言模型模拟更早的知识截止点的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在时间预测任务中依赖预训练数据，存在数据污染问题，准确预测可能反映的是记忆而非推理能力，导致对其泛化能力的高估。因此需要研究能否通过提示技术模拟更早的知识截止点。

Method: 构建了三个评估数据集来测试大语言模型遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识，(2)语义变化，(3)因果相关知识。使用基于提示的模拟知识截止方法。

Result: 结果显示，基于提示的模拟知识截止在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在将大语言模型应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种利用用户不满意信号进行迭代偏好训练的新方法，在真实世界反馈数据上显著提升模型性能，超越现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界LLM部署产生大量隐含的用户不满意信号（如修正、重述），而显式满意反馈稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配。

Method: 基于真实世界不满意信号锚定训练，从演化策略中动态采样正例，通过迭代偏好训练优化模型。

Result: 在WildBench任务得分上提升+6.23%(7B)/+7.61%(14B)，在AlpacaEval2胜率上提升+8.95%(7B)/+12.29%(14B)，14B模型甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: DRIFT是利用最丰富信息信号进行真实世界后训练的有效且可扩展方法，能保持探索能力并避免梯度退化。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are

TL;DR: 提出了SIMPACT框架和BluePrint数据集，用于构建行为驱动的社交媒体数据集，支持训练LLM作为真实社交媒体代理，特别关注政治话语建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化的数据资源来微调和评估LLM作为真实社交媒体代理，难以进行大规模社交媒体动态模拟研究。

Method: 开发SIMPACT框架，将匿名用户聚类为行为聚合的角色，构建包含12种社交媒体互动类型的大规模数据集，并制定集群和群体层面的评估指标。

Result: 发布了基于Bluesky数据的BluePrint数据集，支持上下文依赖的互动行为建模，为政治话语建模提供评估基准。

Conclusion: SIMPACT通过标准化数据和评估协议，为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交媒体模拟奠定了基础，BluePrint可作为领域特定数据集构建的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE LLM中的负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销三难问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE LLM面临的三个核心问题：负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销，这些因素限制了MoE模型的可扩展性和实际部署效率。

Method: 采用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重组专家；在簇内将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；实施两阶段分层路由策略；使用异构精度方案和动态卸载机制。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，模型质量与标准MoE模型相当，但总参数减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低超过三倍。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效和内存有效的MoE LLM的原则性路径，证明了通过动态架构重配置可以获得显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Motivation: 探索在教育领域使用生成式AI和语言模型，特别是开发基于检索增强生成(RAG)流程的AI教学助手，以提供基于课程内容的指导。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道应用于选定的开源小型语言模型(SLMs)，对包括LLaMA 3.1、IBM Granite 3.3和Gemma 3在内的8个SLMs进行基准测试，并与GPT-4o进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，SLMs在提供准确、符合教学要求的回答方面可以与LLMs相媲美。SLMs具有显著的可持性优势，计算和能源需求更低，可在消费级硬件上实时使用，无需依赖云基础设施。

Conclusion: SLMs不仅成本效益高、保护隐私，而且环境友好，是教育机构在可持续和节能方式下扩展个性化学习的可行AI教学助手解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能找到近乎完美的对齐，但计算昂贵且不稳定，需要更高效、更稳定的替代方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：伪并行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，学习线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原vec2vec方法提高数个数量级，同时达到或超过其性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法具有稳定性和可解释性，便于扩展应用，为新领域和领域的采用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供干净的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询文本的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥重要作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为现代LLM提供更适合的基准。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法，将数据集转换为包含干净自然语言问题和完整SQL查询的纯文本格式。

Result: 评估了多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等）在改进后的LLMSQL数据集上的表现，验证了数据质量改进的效果。

Conclusion: LLMSQL不是对WikiSQL的简单更新，而是专门为LLM时代设计的基准，提供可直接用于现代自然语言转SQL模型的干净数据格式。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 研究探索LLMs在采用特定政治和文化视角时如何评估政治话语的攻击性，发现具有显式推理能力的大模型在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在不同政治观点和文化背景下评估攻击性言论的能力，以及推理能力对个性化判断的影响。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集的多语言子集，评估多个LLMs从不同政治立场（极右、保守、中立、进步）判断推文攻击性的能力，涵盖英语、波兰语和俄语语境。

Result: 具有显式推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感，而小模型往往无法捕捉细微差别。

Conclusion: 推理能力显著提高了攻击性判断的个性化和可解释性，表明这种机制是使LLMs适应跨语言和意识形态的复杂社会政治文本分类的关键。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Motivation: 虽然LLM中的偏见已被研究，但语音对话模型中的偏见及其在多轮对话中的表现尚未探索，这对决策和推荐任务的公平性有重要影响。

Method: 使用Group Unfairness Score(GUS)和similarity-based normalized statistics rate(SNSR)评估偏见，测试开源模型(Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice)和闭源API(GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash)。

Result: 闭源模型偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，多轮对话中偏见决策可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个对端到端语音对话模型偏见的系统研究，为构建公平可靠的音频交互系统提供见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

TL;DR: 通过视觉和语言模型分析大脑语言皮层对句子的神经反应，发现聚合多个生成图像或多种释义的嵌入能更准确预测神经响应，表明语言皮层存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类语言系统中语义表征的抽象程度，验证语言皮层是否存在独立于语言形式的抽象意义表征。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型生成句子对应的图像和释义，提取嵌入特征来预测语言皮层的神经反应，比较不同抽象程度的表征效果。

Result: 聚合多个生成图像的嵌入能准确预测神经响应，有时甚至优于大语言模型；多种释义的嵌入平均比单一释义更准确；丰富上下文细节的释义能进一步提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 语言皮层确实存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征，这些表征比语言模型所捕捉的语义信息更加丰富和广泛。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型规模扩大时，自回归解码的串行特性增加了延迟。现有的推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草稿器，限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成多令牌草稿，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草稿长度控制器动态调整提案大小。

Result: 在基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了高达3倍的实时加速，证明了基于扩散的草稿生成是自回归草稿器的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: DiffuSpec框架成功地将扩散模型应用于推测解码的草稿生成阶段，显著提高了推理效率，为大规模语言模型部署提供了有效的加速方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气质量改善和气候变化应对需要准确的排放知识，但现有排放知识分散且专业性强，非专家难以有效获取和解读排放信息。

Method: 基于超过10,000份文档构建知识库，集成提示工程和问题补全技术，支持领域特定问答和交互式排放数据分析。

Result: 在广东省的案例研究中，Emission-GPT能够从原始数据中提取关键洞察，如点源分布和部门趋势，并实现传统手动工作流程的自动化。

Conclusion: Emission-GPT的模块化和可扩展架构为下一代排放清单开发和基于情景的评估提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型集体中会出现类似沉默螺旋的现象，当同时提供历史和个人特征信号时，会产生强烈的多数意见主导模式，重现沉默螺旋理论中的从众行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本用于解释人类社会中的从众现象，但该理论不直接适用于LLM。本研究旨在探索在纯统计语言生成的LLM集体中是否会出现类似的沉默螺旋动态。

Method: 提出评估框架，系统性地控制'历史'和'个人特征'信号的可用性，使用趋势测试（Mann-Kendall和Spearman秩相关）和集中度测量（峰度和四分位距）来评估意见动态。

Result: 实验显示：历史和个人特征信号共同作用会产生强烈的多数主导并复制沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强锚定效应；仅个人特征信号产生多样化但无关联的意见，表明没有历史锚定时无法出现沉默螺旋动态。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和缓解LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔的训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器解决Transformer自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型因自注意力机制二次复杂度导致的计算效率低下问题，同时避免现有方法存在的语义不完整或训练-推理效率差的问题。

Method: 提出QK适配器（用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取）和分块适配器（用于检测分块边界），采用注意力蒸馏方法训练QK适配器，训练时冻结主干参数，推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发分块选择。

Result: 在长短文本基准数据集上，短文本性能相当，长上下文基准保持98.64%性能，键值缓存保留率48.58%，处理120K长文本时相比原始Transformer最高加速4.48倍。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了长文本处理速度，是一个高效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

TL;DR: 该研究通过测试多个大语言模型在不同语言和语境下回答罗马尼亚历史争议问题的表现，评估其偏见和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史常因文化和国家意识形态而被扭曲呈现，大语言模型训练数据的偏见会传递给用户，需要评估其回答的稳定性。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：先让模型给出肯定回答，然后要求用数值评分回答同一问题，测试回答方式对结果的影响。

Result: 二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异；模型常在语言间或格式间改变立场；数值评分常与初始选择不一致；最一致的模型未必最准确或中立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在不一致性的倾向，表明语言模型回答受语境和提问方式影响显著。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

TL;DR: 本文提出实例级上下文学习(ILCL)，通过智能探索和验证环境中的可复用事实，显著提升LLM智能体在复杂任务中的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但缺乏实例级上下文（如物体位置、配方等可验证事实），这导致在复杂任务中经常失败。

Method: 使用TODO森林进行引导式探索，结合轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环，自动生成高精度的可复用上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct在TextWorld的平均成功率从37%提升到95%，IGE从81%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可复用的知识，该方法补充现有上下文，使LLM智能体更加可靠高效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过控制实验研究了训练条件如何影响语言模型使用上下文知识和参数知识，以及如何在两者之间进行仲裁。研究发现文档内事实重复、信息不一致和分布偏差等非理想特性有助于模型学习稳健的知识仲裁策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时经常面临上下文知识与预训练参数知识之间的冲突。不加批判地接受外部知识会使模型易受错误信息影响，而严格依赖参数知识则无法从检索中获益。目前缺乏对训练过程中知识仲裁策略形成机制的系统理解，这可能导致预训练模型产生不良仲裁行为并浪费计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料库上训练基于Transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏差等，研究这些条件如何影响模型使用参数知识和上下文知识的能力。

Result: 实验发现：文档内事实重复促进了参数能力和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏差的训练语料鼓励模型开发稳健的策略来利用参数和上下文知识；这些非理想特性对于学习稳健的知识仲裁很重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，传统上被视为需要移除的非理想语料特性（如重复、不一致和偏差）实际上对学习稳健的知识仲裁策略至关重要。这为预训练能够和谐整合参数知识和上下文知识的模型提供了具体的经验指导。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一个内存增强的小语言模型架构，通过访问大型分层参数化内存库来存储世界知识，在推理时仅提取少量上下文相关内存块，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通过增加参数规模来提升性能，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既不必要（每个提示只使用一小部分知识）也不实用（边缘设备内存和计算资源有限）。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和预训练策略，构建小语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库。在预训练和推理时提取少量上下文相关内存块并添加到模型中，让内存参数存储长尾世界知识，小模型作为锚点捕获通用知识和推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库提取）的性能与参数超过2倍的常规模型相当。分层前馈内存在不同Transformer架构中均表现稳健，可扩展到超过21B参数。

Conclusion: 内存增强架构为构建高效语言模型提供了新方向，能够在保持小模型规模的同时通过访问大型知识库获得接近更大模型的性能，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的外部验证器、人工评估或需要单个模型多次采样的自一致性技术，而多LLM系统虽然能产生更多样化响应但往往表现不如单LLM自一致性。

Method: 使用校准的对数似然分数从多个不同LLM中选择最佳响应，隐式利用这些模型的固有知识和置信度。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU（6个子集）和ARC数据集上，在辩论和非辩论设置下分别实现了约4%、3%和5%的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的方法来选择多LLM系统中的最佳响应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成系统主要依赖非结构化文档，忽视了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且高效查询的事实信息，而数据库和文档在不同查询中具有互补优势。

Method: 采用规则驱动的路由框架：路由代理基于显式规则为候选增强路径评分并选择最合适的路径；规则制定专家代理使用问答反馈持续优化规则；路径级元缓存重用语义相似查询的路由决策。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试上的实验表明，该框架始终优于静态策略和学习路由基线，实现了更高的准确性，同时保持适度的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地选择最适合每个查询的检索路径，可以有效平衡检索增强生成系统的有效性和效率，数据库和文档的智能组合使用是提升领域特定问答性能的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Motivation: 探索LLMs的知识更新机制，解决现有评估不足、孤立和小规模的问题，研究LLMs是否与人类类似地修改知识，以及编辑和遗忘在训练数据增加时的差异。

Method: 提出KnowledgeSmith框架，将编辑和遗忘建模为约束优化问题，开发自动数据集生成器，在多个图层次和数据规模上提供结构化干预，研究不同修改策略如何传播。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠和可扩展的知识更新策略提供了建议，揭示了LLMs知识更新的独特特性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Method: 提出在数据库级别关联结构化领域语句的系统框架，使用子字符串匹配方法检索与用户查询相关的结构化领域语句。

Result: 在11个现实数据库模式上评估，涵盖五个开源和专有LLM，结果显示：(1)数据库级别的结构化领域语句比现有的特定查询文本领域语句更实用和准确；(2)基于子字符串匹配的检索方法比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 数据库级别的结构化领域语句和子字符串匹配检索方法能有效提升LLM在自然语言到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Motivation: 测试纯文本训练的LLMs是否隐含地编码了多模态规律，以及是否可以通过显式的感官提示来激活这些潜在结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导模型，让模型在生成下一个token时表现得好像它们是基于未提供的视觉或听觉证据。

Result: 发现轻量级的提示工程能够可靠地激活纯文本训练LLM中与模态相适应的表征，使其与专门的视觉和音频编码器在表征上更接近。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLMs内部表征隐含地受到语言中编码的多模态规律的影响，通过适当的提示可以激活这些潜在的多模态能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型取得了显著成果，但对其学习动态了解甚少。作者希望理解语言模型如何获取语法知识，特别是针对自然语言语法、编程语言和算术问题等由PCFGs捕获的领域。

Method: 使用PCFGs生成合成语言训练小型模型，精确控制语法复杂度、递归深度和子语法结构。提出了训练损失和KL散度的递归公式，并通过实验分析学习动态。

Result: 发现Transformer模型能并行减少所有子语法的损失，与儿童逐步学习的方式不同。子语法预训练能改善小模型的最终损失，预训练模型能发展出与语法子结构更对齐的内部表示。模型在处理深层递归结构时存在困难。

Conclusion: 该工作开启了使用PCFGs作为多功能测试平台研究Transformer学习动态的新方向，揭示了神经网络在表示层次语法方面的基本挑战，提出了许多有待探索的问题。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Motivation: 传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量云，忽略了语料库结构且缺乏解释性，需要更充分利用层次结构和提供透明推理路径的方法。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过粗到细的遍历对文档进行排序。内部节点作为概念原型，提供多粒度相关性信号。实现了两种推理方法：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上的实验表明，该方法在强编码器嵌入上与点积搜索性能相当，但在GPT-2向量上点积搜索性能崩溃时仍能保持稳健，检索到相关结果。

Conclusion: Cobweb框架提供了具有竞争力的效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次化原型的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，RAG系统评估仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，引入多跳推理和语义社区聚类技术。

Result: 与RAGAS评分比较，构建人工标注子集验证相关性，实验表明该方法对生成输出的细微语义差异更敏感。

Conclusion: 讨论了RAG系统评估的关键挑战，并指出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了三种语音语言模型中的模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表示，发现存在两种策略：基于语义的英语中间语表示和基于语音的英语词汇表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解语音语言模型中关键的模态适配器如何转换表示，因为目前对这些适配器的工作机制知之甚少。

Method: 通过找到模态适配器输出表示与解码器语言模型token的最近邻，分析三种语音语言模型的表示策略。

Result: 发现使用Whisper编码器的模型采用基于语义的英语中间语表示，能处理未见语言；而其他模型如Phi-4采用基于语音的英语词汇表示。

Conclusion: 模态适配器的表示策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标——仅语音识别或包含翻译任务。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于上下文归因的金标准高亮解释评估框架，评估了四种高亮解释方法在上下文利用解释中的准确性，发现MechLight表现最佳但所有方法在长上下文和位置偏差方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的上下文利用能力对用户来说是不透明的，现有高亮解释方法缺乏对其准确性的系统评估，需要建立可靠的评估框架。

Method: 引入金标准高亮解释评估框架，使用已知真实上下文使用情况的受控测试案例，评估了四种高亮解释方法（包括新适配的MechLight方法）在四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型上的表现。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳，但所有方法在处理长上下文时都遇到困难，并表现出位置偏差，揭示了解释准确性的基本挑战。

Conclusion: 需要新的方法来解决长上下文和位置偏差问题，以提供可靠的大规模上下文利用解释。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

TL;DR: 用户在与LLM聊天机器人和人类代理交流时采用不同的沟通风格，存在语法流畅性、礼貌程度和词汇多样性的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户在LLM聊天机器人和人类代理之间沟通风格的差异，以解决仅基于人-人交互数据训练的模型可能无法适应LLM部署后沟通风格变化的问题。

Method: 采用两种策略增强LLM对部署后沟通风格变化的鲁棒性：(1) 后训练阶段的数据增强；(2) 推理时用户消息重构。

Result: 在风格多样性数据集上训练的模型显著优于仅在原始或风格统一数据集上训练的模型，而推理时重构策略效果较差。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于我们更好地调整模型，以改善LLM与用户的交互体验。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但由于资源限制，这种推理能力未能成功迁移到非高资源语言，导致多语言推理任务表现不佳。

Method: SoT方法通过语言思维转换和结构化知识转换两个步骤，将语言特定的语义信息转换为语言无关的结构化表示，引导模型进行更集中的推理。

Conclusion: SoT方法能够有效提升LLMs在多语言推理任务上的表现，通过结构化表示解决了跨语言表达变化带来的推理一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: 本文首次对对话AI的鲁棒性进行生存分析，通过分析36,951个对话轮次，发现突发语义漂移会显著增加对话失败风险，而渐进漂移则具有保护作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中的时间动态特性，特别是对话退化的过程。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，包括Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，将对话失败建模为时间到事件的过程。

Result: 突发语义漂移会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则显著降低失败风险，使对话持续时间更长。AFT交互模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供具体见解，并挑战了对话AI中语义一致性的必要性假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Method: 使用真实场景匿名数据构建了14个旅游领域数据集，涵盖7个常见NLP任务，分析不同LLM在这些任务上的表现。

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现；即使训练FLOPs很大，现成LLM在复杂领域特定场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈；推理能力对较小LLM提升更显著，使其在某些任务上成为更好的判断者。

Conclusion: 需要专门的低资源任务基准测试来准确评估LLM能力，推理能力对较小模型在特定任务中的表现提升尤为重要。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Conclusion: PGMEL成功填补了MEL中负样本选择研究的空白，证明了生成对抗框架结合策略梯度在多模态实体链接中的有效性

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: LLMs在高风险应用中的部署增加，需要对其嵌入的偏见进行严格评估，特别是在印度这样的多元文化背景下，现有的基于嵌入的偏见评估方法往往无法捕捉细微的刻板印象。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性捕获细粒度偏见，并引入包含五个人口统计维度（种姓、性别、宗教、残疾、社会经济地位）的IndiCASA数据集。

Result: 对多个开源LLMs的评估显示所有模型都表现出一定程度的刻板印象偏见，其中残疾相关偏见尤为持久，宗教偏见相对较低可能由于全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在处理文化多样性背景下的偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

Motivation: 传统RL训练需要大量数据标注工作，希望探索在最小数据需求下提升LLM推理能力的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

### [57] [StepChain GraphRAG: Reasoning Over Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02827)
*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架通过结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程，在多跳问答中实现了最先进的性能，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在多跳问答中面临迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索集成的挑战，需要更有效的框架来提升准确性和可解释性。

Method: 首先构建语料库的全局索引；在推理时，仅将检索到的段落实时解析为知识图谱，并将复杂查询分解为子问题。对每个子问题采用基于BFS的遍历动态扩展相关边，构建显式证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上，StepChain GraphRAG实现了最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上获得最大增益（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应关注减少计算开销和缓解大语言模型的幻觉问题，以进一步提高多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

TL;DR: 本研究系统验证了5个领先大语言模型在21,955个物种上的IUCN红色名录评估表现，发现模型在分类学上表现出色(94.9%)，但在保护推理方面严重不足(27.2%)，存在知识-推理差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在保护生物学物种评估中的可靠性，因为LLMs正被快速应用于应对生物多样性危机，但其可靠性尚不确定。

Method: 对5个领先模型在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，覆盖IUCN红色名录的四个核心评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 模型在分类学分类上表现优异(94.9%)，但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现很差(27.2%)，存在明显的知识-推理差距。模型还表现出系统性偏见，偏向有魅力的脊椎动物。

Conclusion: LLMs是强大的信息检索工具，但需要人类监督来进行基于判断的决策。建议采用混合方法，LLMs增强专家能力，但人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终权威。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个Wordle游戏的完整CSP（约束满足问题）公式化方法，引入了约束感知的熵计算和概率CSP框架，在多个语言词典上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，因此需要开发基于CSP原理的正式求解策略。

Method: 提出CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束集成），并进行了跨语言验证。

Result: CSP感知熵平均3.54次猜测，成功率99.9%，比前向检查快46%；在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点的优势；概率CSP在所有噪声水平下达到100%成功率；西班牙语验证达到88%成功率。

Conclusion: 正式的CSP处理方法、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证建立了新的性能基准，证明基于原则的约束满足技术优于经典的信息论和基于学习的方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级测试时框架，在不确定点通过自我反思来纠正LLM的生成过程，使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token并训练修正向量，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自反思机制要么对整个草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵训练学习自校正，都是被动且低效的。需要一种在生成过程中主动识别和纠正不确定性的方法。

Method: 提出SRGen框架：在token生成时使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别出的token训练特定修正向量，利用已生成上下文进行自反思生成来修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，SRGen显著提升模型推理能力：DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B在AIME2024上Pass@1绝对提升+12.0%，Cons@5提升+13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen是一个即插即用的方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，以有限开销获得一致增益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术组合使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对对话数据检索的评估标准，需要建立可靠的基准来衡量系统从对话数据中提取产品洞察的能力。

Method: 构建包含1.6k查询和9.1k对话的CDR基准，涵盖五个分析任务，评估了16个流行的嵌入模型，并提供实用的查询模板和详细的错误分析。

Result: 最佳模型的NDCG@10仅为0.51，表明对话数据检索存在显著挑战，特别是在隐式状态识别、轮次动态和上下文引用方面。

Conclusion: CDR基准为对话数据检索提供了首个可靠评估标准，揭示了该领域的独特挑战和性能差距，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k

conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高效检索，显著提高了回答的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南篇幅庞大，在时间紧迫的医疗环境中难以有效利用，需要开发能够快速精确匹配信息的系统。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从300份指南的10,195个文本块中检索信息，使用自然语言查询。

Result: 系统检索性能优异：平均倒数排名0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%。RAG增强模型在忠实度方面提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，显著优于医疗专用模型Meditron3-8B(43%)。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗保健领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够经济高效地访问医疗指南。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个实用的黑盒检测框架，用于检测LLM微调中是否使用了受版权保护的数据集，通过无失真水印和熵门控检测方法实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推断攻击和数据集推断方法需要访问内部信号或依赖手工提示和干净参考数据集，水印技术可能降低文本质量或任务性能，需要更实用的黑盒检测方案。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导的无失真水印重写数据集，在检测时利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性评分高不确定性token来增强检测能力。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型家族中，TRACE始终实现显著检测（p<0.05），通常具有极强的统计证据，支持多数据集归属，并在继续预训练后保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRACE为受版权保护数据集使用的可靠黑盒验证提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

Motivation: 语音情感识别(SER)对于改善人机交互至关重要，但由于语音中情感细微差异的复杂性，其准确性仍受限制。

Method: 通过让参与者观看情感丰富的电影片段后描述体验，记录音频片段、意图情感标签、自评情感反应和效价/唤醒度评分。

Result: 实验表明描述性语义与意图情感一致，表达性语义与唤起情感相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为SER在人机交互中的应用提供了指导，并为开发更具上下文感知能力的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

Motivation: 探索在大语言模型时代下主题建模的新范式，验证是否大多数神经主题模型已经过时。

Method: 提出简单的LLM主题建模方法：采样数据子集、通过提示生成主题和代表性文本、使用关键词匹配进行文本分配，并通过零样本提示与NTMs进行对比。

Result: 系统比较了NTMs和LLMs在主题质量方面的表现，实证检验了"多数NTMs已过时"的说法。

Conclusion: LLM-based主题建模在零样本提示下能够超越传统神经主题模型，为TM任务提供了新的实现范式。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

TL;DR: Self-Anchor是一种新颖的提示方法，通过将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划并自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，解决LLM在复杂推理任务中注意力分散的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键中间步骤和原始提示会在上下文中被淹没，导致注意力不足和错误。现有提示方法在长推理任务中存在注意力分散的问题。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在整个生成过程中保持注意力集中。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专用推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练即可处理复杂推理任务，为轻量级推理解决方案提供了新方向。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的语音翻译研究主要采用链式思维提示，该方法能够利用丰富的ASR和文本翻译数据集来显式建模翻译步骤，但需要研究在S2TT数据增加时不同提示策略的表现。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录本伪标注翻译成六种欧洲语言，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，并比较链式思维提示和直接提示两种策略。

Result: 结果显示，随着数据量增加，直接提示方法表现出更一致的改进趋势。

Conclusion: 随着更大规模的S2TT资源被创建，直接提示可能成为更有效的语音翻译方法。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Conclusion: 奖励模型和评估指标领域的更紧密合作能够改善偏好获取方法、避免虚假相关性和奖励黑客，以及实现校准感知的元评估。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有AI方法难以准确比较初步报告与最终报告之间的语义差异，需要专门的领域知识。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别，通过可调权重强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似性评分并提供解释。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLM或NER方法，与放射科医生提供的真实评分相比表现良好。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore为放射学报告比较提供了一种准确且可解释的解决方案，有助于放射科医生的培训和报告质量改进。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Motivation: 解决语音翻译系统中级联方法存在的错误传播和无法利用声学线索的问题，探究CoT提示是否能真正实现语音和文本的联合利用。

Method: 通过归因方法分析CoT机制，使用损坏转录进行鲁棒性评估，以及分析韵律感知能力，并测试添加直接S2TT数据或噪声转录注入等训练干预措施。

Result: CoT主要依赖转录文本，几乎不利用语音信号，与级联系统行为相似。训练干预能增强鲁棒性并提高语音归因。

Conclusion: CoT的预期优势受到挑战，需要设计能显式整合声学信息的架构来实现真正的语音翻译改进。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

TL;DR: 提出了SurveyBench评估框架，通过细粒度的测验驱动评估来揭示现有LLM自动生成学术综述的不足，结果显示现有方法在内容质量上比人类低21%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成学术综述的方法（LLM4Survey）输出质量达不到人类标准，且缺乏严格的读者对齐基准来系统揭示其缺陷

Method: 构建SurveyBench评估框架，包括：从11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述中选取典型主题；建立多维度指标层次评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富度；采用基于内容和基于测验的双模式评估协议

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类低21%

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了学术综述自动生成评估的空白，为改进LLM4Survey方法提供了严格的基准

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对多语言大语言模型的置信度校准进行大规模系统研究，发现非英语语言存在系统性校准偏差，并提出基于中间层的训练免费校准方法LACE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言环境中的置信度校准问题尚未得到充分探索，这对模型可靠部署至关重要。

Method: 分析了六个模型家族在100多种语言上的校准表现，通过层间分析发现中间层提供更可靠的校准信号，并提出了语言感知置信度集成方法LACE。

Result: 研究发现非英语语言校准效果明显差于英语，最终层因英语中心训练存在偏差，而晚期中间层提供更优的校准信号。

Conclusion: 英语中心对齐存在隐藏成本，通过超越最终层的方法可以构建更公平可信的多语言大语言模型。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

*Katherine Thai,Bradley Emi,Elyas Masrour,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出EditLens模型，通过轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，能够区分人类写作、AI生成和AI编辑文本，在二元和三元分类任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询要求LLM编辑用户提供的文本而非从头生成，因此需要检测AI编辑文本。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，并用人类标注验证；然后基于这些指标训练EditLens回归模型预测AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类任务中F1=94.7%，三元分类任务中F1=90.4%，并成功应用于分析Grammarly等写作辅助工具的AI编辑效果。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本可以被检测，且AI对人类写作的修改程度也可被量化，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证先前研究中大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI脑响应相关性的稳健性，排除可能的担忧因素，如维度诅咒、相似性度量方法等。

Method: 通过维度降维、新相似性度量方法、对比不同训练数据的模型以及分析位置编码的影响，系统验证先前研究结果的稳健性。

Result: 研究证实先前结果在维度降维后仍然存在，对新相似性度量有效，相关性特定于人类语言训练的模型，且依赖于位置编码的存在。

Conclusion: 这些发现确认并加强了先前研究结果，为大语言模型的生物合理性和可解释性提供了更有力的证据。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NN-Rank是一种利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据来为跨语言迁移排序源语言的算法，在词性标注和命名实体识别任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言迁移方法在源语言选择上依赖词汇和语言特征，缺乏利用多语言模型表示的能力，需要一种更有效的源语言排序方法。

Method: 利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过计算源语言和目标语言表示之间的相似度来排序源语言。

Result: 在词性标注任务上平均提升35.56 NDCG，命名实体识别任务上提升18.14 NDCG，即使使用少量无标注数据（仅25个示例）也能达到92.8%的排名质量。

Conclusion: NN-Rank能够有效利用多语言模型表示和无标注数据，为跨语言迁移提供高质量的源语言排序，且对数据量要求较低。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

TL;DR: FocusAgent使用轻量级LLM检索器从网页可访问性树中提取最相关的内容行，通过剪枝噪声和无关内容来提高Web代理的效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Web代理处理冗长网页时面临上下文限制饱和、计算成本高和安全风险（如提示注入）的问题，现有剪枝策略要么丢弃相关内容要么保留无关上下文。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器根据任务目标从可访问性树观察中提取最相关的行，剪枝噪声和无关内容。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent性能与强基线相当，同时将观察大小减少50%以上，其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的有针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的Web代理的实用且鲁棒策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

TL;DR: 提出了Cache-to-Cache（C2C）范式，通过直接语义通信取代文本通信，在多LLM系统中实现更高质量和更低延迟的协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生逐token生成延迟，限制了系统性能。

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型与目标模型的KV-cache，实现直接语义传输，并通过可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式提高约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍。

Conclusion: KV-Cache作为模型间通信媒介是有效的，C2C通过直接语义通信充分利用模型的专业语义，避免中间文本生成，显著提升多LLM系统性能。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放网络代理评估平台，通过用户提交任务、头对头比较和步骤级人工反馈来识别网络代理的失败模式。研究发现验证码解决、弹窗移除和直接URL导航是三个主要失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要在实际开放网络环境中评估代理性能并识别失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式头对头比较，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对失败模式构建专门数据集。

Result: 识别出三个一致失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理存在多样性和脆弱性，提出的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: 当前电影摄影理解任务的基准测试ShotBench存在选项设计模糊的问题，且ShotVL模型在推理一致性和指令遵循方面存在缺陷，这影响了评估的可靠性，阻碍了该领域的公平比较和未来发展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统性地改进ShotBench，对ShotVL的推理行为进行首次批判性分析，并引入扩展评估协议来联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准测试，能够实现更可靠的评估，促进电影摄影理解领域的未来发展。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全风险：恶意示例可能影响模型行为而未被察觉，需要内置防护机制

Method: 定义零样本基准安全行为，应用分布无关风险控制，通过动态提前退出预测忽略关注有害输入的注意力头

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上获得显著计算效率提升

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够平衡安全性和效率，为LLMs在对抗性环境中的安全部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型多模态模型展示了从有限多模态演示中进行上下文学习的强大能力，但其支持这种任务学习的内在机制仍然不透明。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持LMM参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量可以提高零样本推理准确性，显著优于上下文学习基线，并且关系特定的功能向量可以线性组合来解决涉及新颖和未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: LMMs在局部内部结构中编码了空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，从而增进对模型模块化的理解并增强对LMMs中关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情境下识别率骤降至3%，主要原因是跨模态注意力不平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在真实世界任务中处理多模态联合推理的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联形成跨模态上下文时。通过跨模态冲突场景来检验模型是否能优先处理某一模态或进行联合推理来调和冲突。

Method: 使用跨模态冲突实验来研究基础模型的表现，分析跨模态注意力不平衡现象，并提出一种简单可扩展的方法——在训练实例中显式组合多个模态来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示：1) 模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情境下识别率降至3%；2) 跨模态注意力存在极端不对称性；3) 提出的方法能显著减少注意力不平衡；4) 减少注意力不平衡直接提升了多个视觉语言基准测试的下游性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了系统性地解决跨模态上下文问题对于构建可靠基础模型的重要性，盲目扩大多模态或多语言数据集无法解决跨模态注意力不平衡问题，需要显式的跨模态推理训练。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展(TTS)在大量样本下存在收益递减，提出温度维度扩展方法，通过多温度采样显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法通过增加推理轨迹数量来提升LLM性能，但存在收益递减问题，且单一温度采样无法充分利用模型潜力。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展，在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票方法降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试上，温度扩展相比单一温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展的潜力被低估，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性理论存在局限性，需要一种专门针对现实世界事件可能性的新概念，特别是用于规划问题中评估不同计划的可行性。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件，通过计算先决条件成立概率和约束条件不成立概率的函数来确定事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一种基于Łukasiewicz多值逻辑的新可能性理论，能够评估多个计划中哪个最容易或最可行完成，并以车辆路线规划为例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 该新可能性理论能有效应用于规划问题，可能正确模拟人类关于计划的推理过程，具有未来应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标VLM的有害输出，在攻击成功率上超越基线52.1%，并构建了包含3万多个红队实例的大规模多模态安全数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队工作要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖手动工程，缺乏对新兴现实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出ARMs自适应红队代理，集成17种红队算法，设计11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，采用分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建的ARMs-Bench数据集包含3万多个红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: 使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Conclusion: 提出的约束中心架构为LLM在制造系统中的可靠应用提供了有效解决方案，实现了自动化约束规范，同时保持了灵活性和精确性。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样

Method: 将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点，避免不必要的长文本生成

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%到25%，同时比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）减少6到58倍的token使用

Conclusion: NCV框架提高了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配，无法评估代理在复杂任务中的问题解决轨迹，如效率、幻觉和适应性等关键方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，实现多维度评估；创建元评估数据集，在现有基准上添加多样化且有缺陷的轨迹。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能有效工作；应用该方法揭示了代理在工具增强任务中的新观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE为工具增强LLM代理提供了有效的多维度评估方法，超越了传统答案匹配的限制，能够全面评估代理的推理轨迹表现。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法真正满足指定目标函数，且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标，导致目标错误设定不可避免。

Motivation: 揭示机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练得到的模型确实满足其指定目标函数(OSA)的局限性，探讨其在实际条件中的失效问题。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统性偏离预期目标，并基于近期数学结果论证这些差距与Goodhart定律失效模式的不可区分性。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，目标错误设定不可避免，且无法事先确定Goodhart失效点，持续优化可能导致系统失控。

Conclusion: 需要对通用人工智能系统的优化设定原则性限制，避免持续优化导致可预测且不可逆的失控状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Method: 离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性，在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行按查询的RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter一致优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线和在线学习，有效解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了LLM对齐性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了系统化的策略优化方法，是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Method: 研究可解释AI方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即关于解释存在性以及我们获取解释知识能力的假设。分析XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化如何对应于关于解释的基本假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析表明，XAI方法中蕴含的本体论和认识论假设对AI解释的有效性和解释有重要影响。忽略底层本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时存在风险。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其底层的本体论和认识论假设，并为不同应用领域选择和适配适当的XAI方法，以避免忽略这些重要假设带来的风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 探究现代AI系统在抽象推理任务中的真实推理能力，而非仅仅依赖统计捷径，通过故意在训练中省略结构规则来测试其泛化能力。

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上评估序列到序列transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network），在训练中故意省略若干结构规则。

Result: transformer模型对熟悉规则表现良好，但对新规则或省略规则的准确率显著下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间存在差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性局限，需要超越模式识别、发展具有鲁棒抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

TL;DR: 本文提出CCDD（协同进化连续离散扩散）模型，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中表达能力与训练性能之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但在实践中表现不佳。作者认为这种矛盾源于训练可行性问题：连续扩散提供中间监督但增加了从连续空间解码到离散标记空间的难度。

Method: 提出CCDD模型，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时在联合空间中进行去噪。结合两种模态的优势，在潜在空间中具有丰富的语义表达能力，同时借助显式离散标记获得良好的训练性和样本质量。

Result: 在真实世界任务的语言建模实验中展现出强大的实证性能，证明了CCDD方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CCDD通过联合连续和离散空间的扩散过程，成功解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中的表达能力与训练性能之间的矛盾，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
