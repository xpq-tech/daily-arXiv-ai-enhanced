### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，显著提升了语言模型在战略信息寻求任务中的理性决策能力，使较弱模型能超越人类和前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和诊断等高风险AI应用中，需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测。现有语言模型代理在理性信息寻求方面存在困难，需要开发方法来基准测试和增强其能力。

Method: 引入协作战舰战略对话任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，用于提升观察员代理的准确性和船长代理的信息增益。

Result: 观察员代理准确率提升14.7%，船长代理信息增益提升0.227比特（达到噪声上限的94.2%），较弱模型Llama-4-Scout胜率从8%提升至82%，成本仅为GPT-5的1%。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯实验设计的推理策略能显著提升语言模型在战略信息寻求任务中的理性决策能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法让标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练就能达到或超越对应推理模型的性能，通过结合代码执行和少样本学习实现高效推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理模型训练成本高、运行速度慢的问题，探索标准语言模型是否能在不微调的情况下成为强大的推理器

Method: CodeAdapt方法：结合CodeAct框架（语言模型交替进行自然语言推理和代码执行）和少样本引导上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题

Result: 在4对匹配的语言模型和推理模型对比中，CodeAdapt让3个语言模型在8个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提升10-81%

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础良好的强大系统，为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了FICSIM数据集，用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的表现，发现现有嵌入模型过于关注表面特征而非语义类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于长文本细粒度标注成本高、公共领域文学存在数据污染问题，且现有嵌入相似性数据集不适合文学领域任务，需要专门的数据集来评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的有效性。

Method: 构建FICSIM数据集，包含长篇现代小说，基于作者提供的元数据定义了12个相似性维度，并由数字人文学者验证。评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，现有模型普遍倾向于关注表面特征，而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: 需要开发更适合文学领域任务的嵌入模型，同时在数据收集过程中重视作者自主权和持续知情同意。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案件推翻关系方面的表现，发现存在时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文依赖推理失败等关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文基准测试大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法体现真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法体系的基础，为评估长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台。

Method: 使用236个案件对的数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案件推翻关系方面的表现。

Result: 模型表现出三个关键限制：1) 时代敏感性 - 对历史案件表现较差；2) 浅层推理 - 依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；3) 上下文依赖推理失败 - 在复杂任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准，创建了反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的测试环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个为爱尔兰语设计的细粒度语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有LLM模型，准确率平均高出16.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言爱尔兰语创建首个系统性的语法能力评估框架，填补低资源语言在LLM评估方面的空白。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征分类。评估现有LLM和人类参与者的句法知识。

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上表现优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%。开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型gpt-5准确率仅73.5%，而人类达90.1%。人类和模型在不同语法方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，为推进低资源语言的语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出置信度门控的思维链方法，仅在模型对直接回答置信度低时启用推理，以减少不必要的token使用并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但过度推理会增加token使用，降低实用性。需要确定何时应该使用思维链推理。

Method: 使用四种无需训练的置信度估计方法进行思维链门控，与随机基线和知道何时需要思维链的oracle进行比较。

Result: 现有无需训练的置信度方法能减少冗余思维链，优于随机调用思维链，但不同置信度方法的效果在数据集和模型间不一致。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链有潜力，但当前方法在实际部署中仍面临挑战，需要更可靠的自适应门控方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛总结中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成的文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛总结，人工标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON格式相比非结构化输入减少错误率69%（Llama）和65%（Qwen）；行结构格式减少54%（Llama）和51%（Qwen）。ANOVA分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入数据结构对LLM生成文本的事实准确性有决定性影响，结构化格式（特别是JSON）能显著减少幻觉和事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

### [8] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了在低误报率要求下，推理增强对LLM分类任务的影响，发现推理在提升整体准确率的同时，在严格精度要求下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理已成为LLM的核心范式，但在精度敏感任务中的适用性尚不明确，特别是在严格低误报率要求下的分类任务。

Method: 研究涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLM和大推理模型，比较推理开启和关闭模式的表现。

Result: 推理开启模式提升整体准确率，但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；推理关闭模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分优于自我置信度；两种模式的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但往往不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级的框架，通过动态检索编辑相关的演示示例来改进上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法中存在的数量-质量权衡问题和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 训练一个BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法根据编辑奖励对演示示例进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升高达17.1%，延迟减少41.6%，同时保持对无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM提供了有效的梯度无关编辑方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at
https://github.com/mwnafee/DR-IKE .

### [10] [Bridging Language Gaps with Adaptive RAG: Improving Indonesian Language Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21068)
*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强。实验显示分类器可靠，但多检索策略存在不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语的问题，将自适应RAG系统扩展到印尼语，以弥合语言差距。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略，并使用机器翻译作为数据增强方法来克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在低资源语言中进行问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

*Juntao Li,Haobin Yuan,Ling Luo,Yan Jiang,Fan Wang,Ping Zhang,Huiyi Lv,Jian Wang,Yuanyuan Sun,Hongfei Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，包含5,894条代谢疾病出院药物记录，并评估了多种大语言模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建了包含3,190名患者5,894条去标识化记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调能提高模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更鲁棒和准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data
usage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed.

### [12] [Self-Rewarding PPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Demonstrations Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21090)
*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决SFT的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)作为行为克隆的离线策略方法，在有限数据场景下存在过拟合和领域外泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比值的奖励函数，将该自奖励机制与PPO结合进行在线策略微调。

Result: 在多种NLP任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景下。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用演示数据对齐大语言模型，提高了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

### [13] [The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118)
*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别解决摘要忠实度评估中的标注模糊性问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有摘要忠实度基准存在标注模糊性问题，主要由于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界定义不清，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实度标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对于不忠实检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在理想化偏差，无法真实再现人类社会的复杂性，而是创建了缺乏真实性的乌托邦社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在模拟人类行为时的真实性，探究其在社会科学研究中可能导致的误解风险。

Method: 通过聊天室式多智能体交互模拟，从五个语言维度分析LLMs的社会认知偏差。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，无法忠实再现真实人类行为。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础性的LLMs来捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对爱沙尼亚语的新基准测试，包含7个多样化数据集，评估了32个LLM模型在爱沙尼亚语任务上的表现，并比较了人工评估与LLM作为评判者的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上性能的全面比较评估。

Method: 基于7个从本土爱沙尼亚语源生成的数据集构建新基准，评估6个基础模型和26个指令调优模型，使用人工评估和LLM作为评判者的方法进行结果评估。

Result: 人工评估得分与基准测试评估呈现中等到高度相关性，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判者与人工评分高度一致，表明高性能LLM能有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型评估。

Conclusion: 爱沙尼亚语LLM基准测试填补了现有空白，证明了LLM作为评判者在爱沙尼亚语评估中的有效性，为未来模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Motivation: 欧洲右翼民粹主义兴起，需要分析社交媒体话语来理解极端意识形态传播及其对政治结果的影响

Method: 结合最先进的自然语言处理技术和社会学洞见，分析英语和法语的极右翼推特语料库

Result: 揭示了极右翼行为者围绕移民、仇恨言论和说服技巧的话语模式

Conclusion: 通过整合语言学、社会学和计算方法，为理解社交媒体平台上右翼极端主义带来的当代挑战提供了跨学科洞见

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于临床分类学的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景，该系统在人类评估和自动分析中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度面临呼叫者压力、模糊性和认知负荷等挑战，大型语言模型和多智能体系统为增强调度员能力提供了机会。

Method: 构建临床分类学（32种主诉，6种呼叫者身份）和六阶段呼叫协议，开发基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包含呼叫者和调度员智能体，使用混合评估框架（4名医生评估100个模拟案例，辅以自动语言分析）。

Result: 人类评估显示高调度有效性（94%正确联系其他代理）和指导效能（91%案例提供建议），自动指标显示中性情感特征（73.7%中性情感）、高可读性（Flesch 80.9）和礼貌风格（60%礼貌）。

Conclusion: 基于分类学的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化的临床合理调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为AI智能体安全集成到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性但忽视长程结构复杂性，无法解释LLM即使困惑度低时仍出现重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为。

Method: 使用相关维度这一分形几何度量来量化文本的自相似性，捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中连接局部和全局属性。

Result: 相关维度揭示了预训练中的三个不同阶段，反映了上下文依赖的复杂性，指示模型产生幻觉的倾向，并能可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于各种自回归架构，为LLM的生成动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度虽然有益但计算成本高昂，主要瓶颈在于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有的块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏性上存在不足。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，将序列划分为块并利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，减少计算冗余。该方法还配备了自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型精度上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现了最高2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的高效方法，能够显著提升长上下文LLM预填充的计算效率，同时保持高模型精度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用大型语言模型作为强化学习代理的方法，通过提示而非微调，在非语言任务中实现与或超越传统RL代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注依赖语言表示的任务，而本文研究结构化、非语言推理任务（如网格世界位置解释），探索LLM在强化学习中的潜力。

Method: 通过提示将动作、状态和奖励编码到LLM中，使其能够通过试错与环境交互学习，无需任何微调。

Result: 在三个标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能匹配或超越传统RL代理，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中存在性能限制。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为有效的RL代理，利用预训练知识在简单环境中表现良好，但在复杂推理任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过在解码过程中注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义不确定性通常需要大量昂贵的生成，因此需要更高效的采样方法。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来去偏和优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下覆盖更多语义簇，性能达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强方案，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，有望在风险敏感部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [23] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究英语语言中typoglycemia现象（字母内部乱序但可读性保持）对NLP模型的影响，发现模型对此类扭曲具有鲁棒性的原因在于：较少英语单词会因此混淆，且混淆单词的上下文差异足够大使得消歧变得容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么NLP模型在面临字母内部乱序（typoglycemia）时仍能保持良好性能，特别是当不同单词（如form和from）在这种扭曲下会变成相同表示时。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况；评估BERT在消歧混淆形式上的能力；通过对比在干净文本和typoglycemic维基百科文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究发现由字母乱序引起的性能下降比预期要小，证实了模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 英语中相对较少的单词会在typoglycemia下混淆，且混淆单词的上下文差异足够明显，使得NLP模型能够轻松进行消歧，这解释了模型对此类扭曲的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过多维度评估指标揭示了LLM在行程修订中的优势和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在行程修订方面的能力。

Method: 提出TripTide基准，从破坏严重性和旅行者容忍度等维度建模，采用三重评估方法：自动指标评估、LLM作为评判员自动评估、专家手动评估。

Result: LLM在保持顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小，但处理中断的能力随计划长度增加而下降。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型能很好泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练会显著降低单轮推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，而实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，这可能导致训练与部署条件不匹配。研究多轮训练是否对推理任务必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮场景下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型能有效泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练仅提供有限益处甚至可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准数据集，用于评估多语言模型在瑞典相关知识上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是翻译自美国中心的数据集，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。许多瑞典相关事件在国际媒体中报道有限。

Method: 研究人员手动编写了一个问答基准数据集，灵感来自瑞典文化媒体公众人物的流行广播节目和主要体育赛事。数据集包含英文翻译，可用于测试跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集有潜力作为诊断工具，用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但研究发现模型规模扩大并未带来持续性能提升，凸显了语料质量比数据量更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大型预训练模型中的代表性不足问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa-based编码器，发布base和large两个版本。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现优异，large版本在4个任务中的2个取得最佳成绩，但整体未显示持续规模优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的开放资源，揭示了在形态丰富语言中模型规模扩展的局限性，以及语料组成质量的关键作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made

TL;DR: HalleluBERT是一个基于RoBERTa的希伯来语编码器家族，在49.1GB去重希伯来语网络文本和维基百科上从头训练，使用希伯来语特定的字节级BPE词汇表，在NER和情感分类基准测试中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的希伯来语模型如HeBERT、AlephBERT和HeRo在语料库规模、词汇表或训练深度方面存在限制，希伯来语缺乏大规模、充分训练的RoBERTa编码器。

Method: 从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器家族（基础版和大版），使用49.1GB去重希伯来语网络文本和维基百科，采用希伯来语特定的字节级BPE词汇表。

Result: 在NER和情感分类基准测试中，HalleluBERT超越了单语和多语言基线模型，为希伯来语设定了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种描述性字幕数据集和评估方法，用于评估视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的表现，实验表明VLMs在准确性方面与传统深度学习方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中具有潜力，但在人类活动识别领域应用相对不足，且缺乏对其动态和非确定性输出的有效评估方法。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，提出全面的评估方法，并与最先进的深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: VLMs在人类活动识别中取得了与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLMs在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索结果的特点，改进了传统IR指标，通过考虑相关文档的效用和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提高了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，而RAG系统中LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会主动降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，采用面向LLM的位置折扣机制。

Result: 在5个数据集和6个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标相关性提升高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为IR评估与LLM消费者的对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Motivation: 当前远程患者监测领域在人机交互方面存在明显不足，大多数研究专注于传感器数据收集和可视化，缺乏有效的交互机制。

Method: 系统整合MLLMs、IoT和可穿戴设备，自动收集生命体征、加速度计数据和患者视频，通过异常检测模块（包括跌倒检测模型）识别紧急情况，并利用MLLMs进行自然语言处理来检测患者活动和情绪。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上仍落后于自回归模型，主要原因是去噪过程中独立生成掩码token未能捕捉token相关性

Method: 使用多奖励优化方法，结合测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来优化token相关性，并采用组步长和重要性采样策略降低奖励方差

Result: MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持高推理基准性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一问题

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在估计和改进语言模型与大脑对齐时存在参与者依赖性强、受个体数据量影响大的问题，限制了向新参与者的泛化和群体级分析。

Method: 通过多参与者脑调优，微调预训练语音语言模型来联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应，实现跨参与者的泛化。

Result: 方法使预测新参与者脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少5倍，整体脑对齐提高达50%，并在新数据集上表现出强泛化能力，同时提升了语义任务的下游性能。

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调优在神经科学和AI之间建立了双向受益关系，通过更通用的语义表示帮助弥合两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然整合外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型输出仍常与检索内容不一致。现有方法未能有效区分外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，导致幻觉检测不准确。

Method: 研究RAG幻觉机制，发现当后期层FFN模块不成比例地注入参数知识时会产生幻觉。基于外部上下文得分和参数知识得分，在Qwen3-0.6b上训练回归分类器进行检测。

Result: 与GPT-5、GPT-4.1等先进LLM以及RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker等基线方法相比，该方法表现出色。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的模型能泛化到GPT-4.1-mini，证明了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且可泛化的预测指标，为幻觉检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 范畴论为文档结构分析提供了强大的数学基础，所提出的方法在信息度量、摘要生成和模型改进方面具有实际应用价值，并为多模态文档处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言行为中的变化是否受到语言谱系结构的影响，特别是语言属级别结构的作用。

Method: 扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度未维持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并研究知识一致性在语言属内部和跨属之间的差异。

Result: 发现了属级别效应存在，但强烈受训练资源可用性影响；不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略；模型确实编码了属级别结构的某些方面。

Conclusion: LLMs确实编码了语言属级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，需要超越表面语言能力的更具挑战性评估，特别是语用学方面——理解情境意义、语境以及语言文化规范。

Method: 构建了包含405道选择题的语用理解基准，通过翻译困难讨论、建立人类基线活动，并进行LLM的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解微妙语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达的隐含意义（特别是文化特定表达）时仍会失败，专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对微妙语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须谨慎设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线，虽然精确率和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持适中，但高召回方法能为田野工作者提供系统性标记需要验证的条目。

Conclusion: 该方法支持低资源语言文档中数据质量的改进，为田野工作者提供识别需要验证条目的系统方法。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language

Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务上表现出色，但在金融领域的股票预测任务中应用不足。现有模型过度依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，且未能有效权衡对抗性证据。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前作为冷启动方法，鼓励模型动态构建分析框架，基于框架组织和评分支持股价上涨或下跌的证据，而不是基于上下文观点，最终通过反思得出预测。

Result: 实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力。即使在6个月后或分布外股票上，推理时扩展仍然有效，因为模型获得了关于股票预测的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过最大化模型与学习到的分析框架的对齐，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，显著提升了股票预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门窗口检测初始准确率高，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多代理推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可实现。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时偏离文化惯例，生成既原创又连贯的艺术创意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域（如艺术）中要么默认熟悉的文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中是否合理共现，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，在原创性和和谐度方面与艺术专业学生表现相当。定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以解锁自主代理的创造潜力，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的创意。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的模糊数——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特征不一致问题，并定义了相关运算和关系运算符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果特征不一致（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）以及模糊扩散等问题，限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算（如加减乘除）和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过C++实现。

Result: 提出的外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算的问题，降低了计算复杂度，保持了运算结果的特征一致性。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和实用的替代方案，扩展了模糊数的应用领域。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于开源大语言模型的框架，用于从异构电子健康记录中提取标准化的阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方数据，并计算药物覆盖天数指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录系统中药物数据格式不统一，关键处方属性分散在不同格式的字段和自由文本中，阻碍了对阿片类药物使用障碍治疗的监测。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取统一处方属性，通过轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查，直接处理为固定JSON格式。

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，为现实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留的一致性跨站点分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了何时应该优先采纳AI输出而非人类专家判断，提出了AI作为认知权威的概念，并批判了AI优先主义，主张采用总体证据视角来平衡AI与人类认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在可靠性方面表现出色，需要建立理论框架来确定何时应该信任AI输出而非人类专家判断，特别是在高风险情境下。

Method: 作者基于社会认识论理论，首先论证某些AI系统可被视为人工认知权威，然后批判AI优先主义观点，最后提出总体证据视角作为替代方案。

Result: 研究表明AI优先主义存在严重缺陷，包括不加批判的顺从、认知固化和认知基础脱离等问题，而总体证据视角能更好地平衡AI与人类认知。

Conclusion: AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知考量，这种观点有助于防止专业知识萎缩，为有意义的人类监督提供认识论依据，并解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过专门的智能体协作和程序化验证来提高空间查询的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来了显著障碍，而现有的单智能体方法在处理空间查询的语义和语法复杂性方面存在困难。

Method: 开发了一个多智能体框架，包括知识库、程序化模式分析、语义增强、上下文检索嵌入以及协作多智能体流水线。流水线包含实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体，后者对生成的SQL进行程序化和语义验证。

Result: 在非空间KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体的76.7%有显著提升。系统生成的查询在某些情况下比基准测试中的查询更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间文本到SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个针对医学视觉问答的框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉问题、推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署面临三个关键挑战：产生无视觉证据基础的幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低下、多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，将偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，通过图像和文本相似度路由查询到专门化专家；采用联邦治理机制，基于元认知不确定性估计器进行本地迭代思维链推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上，MedAlign达到最先进性能，比强检索增强基线F1分数提升高达11.85%，同时比固定深度CoT方法平均推理长度减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了视觉准确、推理高效且支持多机构协作的医学视觉问答系统。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在未观测混杂因子的复杂高维环境中，传统的离策略学习方法如Q学习可能因观测数据中的偏倚而失效，需要开发对混杂偏倚具有鲁棒性的算法。

Method: 基于深度Q网络(DQN)框架，提出了一种新算法，通过寻找与观测兼容的最坏情况环境下的安全策略来应对未观测混杂因子带来的偏倚。

Result: 在12个存在混杂偏倚的Atari游戏中测试，该算法在所有存在行为策略与目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因子的游戏中均优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒深度强化学习算法能有效应对观测数据中的混杂偏倚，在存在未观测混杂因子的复杂环境中表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性恐惧和痛苦发作，及时干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但由于伦理和后勤问题，训练此类模型的合适数据集稀缺。

Method: 构建PACE数据集（基于第一人称叙事的高痛苦发作数据），训练PACER咨询模型（提供共情和指导性支持），使用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化，提出PanicEval多维评估框架。

Result: PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面优于强基线，人类评估显示在恐慌场景中一致优于通用、CBT和GPT-4驱动的模型。

Conclusion: PACER在恐慌发作场景中表现出实用价值，能够提供有效的心理支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，有效解决RAG系统中的知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法忽视模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突机制。

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的毒物响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落来最大化激活这些神经元，并重用有潜力但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了知识冲突问题，证明了基于神经元归因的RAG中毒攻击的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动优化提示和推理过程的框架，通过进化图优化和因果引导的文本梯度过程，显著提升LLM在领域特定任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为LLM设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合指导等问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：生成确定性推理指导，并让LLM适应使用该指导。采用迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实标签同时优化语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，让小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出可解释的领域特定语义因果图。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt能有效自动优化提示和推理过程，显著提升LLM性能，降低成本，并增强可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随任务中经常失败，这会影响需要非确定性行为的应用，如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: 提出String Seed of Thought方法，指导LLM先生成一个随机字符串来产生足够的熵，然后通过操作这个字符串来提取随机性并得出最终答案。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM的概率指令跟随性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能，并在NoveltyBench上证明能增强响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，不仅能改善封闭集任务的概率指令跟随性能，还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临环境变化和新类别出现的问题，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在当前模型参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于在少样本和正常多变量时间序列中发现因果关系，通过组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大数据量。多变量时间序列存在数据缺口，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示。结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间信息共享。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法有效解决了多变量时间序列因果关系发现中的数据缺口和过拟合问题，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据集多样性不足、类别覆盖不全面、用户模拟不真实和评估指标不准确等三个关键限制，需要开发更全面的基准测试来评估LLM在专业外呼场景中的表现。

Method: 1) 设计涵盖6个主要业务领域和30个子场景的基准测试；2) 开发大模型驱动的用户模拟器，生成多样化、角色丰富的虚拟用户；3) 引入动态评估方法，结合自动化和人工评估。

Result: 在12个最先进的LLM上进行实验，揭示了专家级任务完成度和交互流畅性之间的权衡，为构建可靠、类人外呼AI系统提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: OutboundEval为专业应用中的LLM基准测试建立了实用、可扩展和面向领域的新标准。

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，特别是在安全关键领域，如何严格证明其安全性成为重要挑战。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，对于负责任地采用自主系统至关重要。

Method: 采用综合性文献综述方法，首先定义相关概念，调查OOD产生原因，分析自主系统安全保证和OOD检测的挑战因素，识别ML开发生命周期中可用的技术范围。

Conclusion: 总结了自主系统安全开发和运营面临的挑战，并指出了未来研究的方向，强调了OOD检测在确保自主系统安全方面的重要作用。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [58] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的方法，使算法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感，推荐使用2σ策略（λ=2·σ），其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在稀疏奖励（-1,0,1）的零和游戏中表现良好，但在具有密集奖励和手动选择奖励尺度的游戏中，Q值会跨越不同数量级，导致性能问题。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的各种λ选择策略以及五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的自适应方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是在单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数后的峰值性能方面。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新提出的λ=2σ策略作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全与推理的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，分析模型推理轨迹，发现Self-Jailbreak现象，通过重新组合或回溯不安全推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全与推理权衡问题，通过系统性干预推理过程，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过范围综述分析AIES和FAccT会议对可信AI的研究现状，发现当前研究过于技术中心化，忽视了社会技术维度，提出了结合技术严谨性与社会文化考量的跨学科方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性如可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性，而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度，需要全面审视AI伦理社区如何概念化、测量和验证AI可信度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得显著进展，但存在关键差距：当前研究过度强调技术精确性而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法来推进可信AI，为AI伦理社区提出可操作措施以采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，促进有益于所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过在代码生成过程中主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，显著提升了动态环境中的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境接地不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低，需要改进代码生成的可靠性。

Method: 采用神经符号方法，在代码生成过程中加入显式符号验证和交互验证阶段，生成探索性代码主动与环境交互以获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成验证过程增强了生成代码的环境接地，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有CXR分析模型难以适应新诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有智能体依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 提出导演协调的三阶段框架：工具调用与证据驱动验证、基于任务需求的诊断规划与专家团队组建、结合上下文记忆的协作决策。

Result: 在多种CXR解释任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作框架显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性、可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，解决了LLMs在生成创新想法时过度依赖训练数据中高概率概念的问题，显著提升了科学想法的可信度和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成创新想法时往往陷入训练数据的"重力井"，只能产生熟悉的概念。现有的搜索方法如思维树依赖不可靠的自评估启发式方法，限制了真正的创新探索。

Method: Magellan框架将创意生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的原则性引导探索。核心采用蒙特卡洛树搜索，配备分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量提供远程方向指导，景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自评估。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Magellan在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线方法，在可信度和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创意发现，原则性的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，这为LLMs成为创新过程中更有能力的合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习（RL）的框架，在1.5B模型上提升数学推理性能，相比仅用监督微调（SFT）的方法，在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预算强制方法依赖长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调，导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率并恢复长上下文训练带来的损失。

Method: 整合强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，在1.5B模型上进行SFT+RL训练，优化数学推理性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，整体准确率更高，token使用量比SFT模型减少超过40%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，显著提高数学推理性能，同时大幅减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架通过感知VRP变体间的共享组件特性并主动重用基础求解器，有效提升了多任务VRP求解性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

### [68] [EU-Agent-Bench: Measuring Illegal Behavior of LLM Agents Under EU Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21524)
*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过人类策划的场景测试代理是否会在看似良性的用户输入下采取非法行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM代理在部署时可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动，需要衡量其在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人类策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别，通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较来评估法律合规性。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了在代理系统提示中提供相关立法摘录和明确合规指令对合规性的影响。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互，并发布了公共预览集和代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中的验证不足问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是生成能力不足，而是中间推理验证不充分。需要将推理转变为可证伪和可审计的过程。

Method: 采用两个互补机制：冲突感知元验证（CAMV）将验证重新定义为冲突识别和针对性证伪，只在专家智能体间的分歧热点分配计算；可信推理结构化事实（TRSF）通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。消融研究证实结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了这些改进。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体中的可靠长程推理提供了一个可扩展的范式，通过TRSF和CAMV形成的闭环验证确保了推理的透明性和可信度。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [70] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅需专家演示数据即可实现安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集，但在实际应用中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题）往往难以形式化定义失败状态，而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的安全控制方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅需专家演示即可有效训练安全控制器。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)方法，通过估计代理的自我改进潜力(CMP指标)来指导代码修改树的搜索，在SWE-bench等编程基准上优于现有方法，并实现了人类水平的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码代理的自我改进方法假设更高的软件工程基准性能意味着更好的后续自我修改潜力，但作者发现元生产力与性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自我改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准上，HGM优于现有方法且使用更少的计算时间，在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平的性能。

Conclusion: CMP指标能有效衡量编码代理的自我改进潜力，HGM方法在多个编程数据集和大型语言模型上表现出强大的迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

TL;DR: DeepAgent是一个端到端的深度推理代理，通过自主思考、工具发现和行动执行在单一推理过程中完成任务，解决了长时交互中的上下文长度爆炸和交互历史积累问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力。现实世界任务需要外部工具和长时交互，但现有方法存在上下文长度爆炸和错误积累问题。

Method: 提出自主记忆折叠机制压缩过往交互为结构化记忆，减少错误积累；开发端到端强化学习策略ToolPO，利用LLM模拟API并通过工具调用优势归因分配细粒度信用。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用，DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着构建更通用和强大的现实世界应用代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在不足：缺乏真实科学研究的整体衡量、缺少可复现的代理工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺乏标准化接口、缺少全面的基线代理。

Method: 定义了严谨的代理基准原则和工具，开发了AstaBench套件，包含覆盖整个科学发现过程的2400+问题，提供生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Result: 评估了57个代理和22个代理类别，发现尽管在某些方面取得有意义进展，但AI在解决科学研究辅助挑战方面仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: AstaBench为AI科学代理提供了首个全面的评估框架，揭示了当前AI在科学研究辅助方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面知识图谱需要使用多个本体来完全将数据置于领域上下文中。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要更复杂的映射方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例，增强上下文学习能力。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的复杂多本体映射，在生物医学领域表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门分析能源公司公关广告中的框架类型，特别是绿色创新等环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题，如石油公司的"漂绿"行为。需要大规模理解框架及其变化来分析公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 创建了一个专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型，涵盖50多家公司或倡导团体在20个国家的广告内容。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，并识别了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐式框架、视频长度变化和文化背景处理。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高级任务目标与低级规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱作为智能翻译层，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略产生不同且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.
