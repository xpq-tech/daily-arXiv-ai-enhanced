Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently\nrely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When\npuzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a\nstriking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?\nTo what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general\nway of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these\nthings systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25\nwell-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve\nreasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate\neleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom\nrecall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious\nrationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this\nissue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to\ndetect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error\ncategories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these\ncategories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models\nsignificantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom\nrecall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs\noften fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap\nbetween linguistic fluency and logical understanding."}

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the\nutility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on\nimproving the robustness of learned knowledge representations."}

Many mathematical\nproblems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion\nsuch as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models\n(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their\nconjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or\nproof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this\ngap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the\nevaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing\ncapabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation\npipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is\nsubstantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during\nevaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We\ndesign an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and\nautoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first\nsuccessful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1\nand 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite\nknowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation\nperformance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and\ninvestigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.\nFinally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward\nimproving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning."}

However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to\noverly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but\nincorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes\nare unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective\ngeneration space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model\nconsiders for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with\nground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where\nmodels diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection\nmetrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity\nand uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,\nproviding interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.\nWe demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and\npredicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting\noverthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to\nexpand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs."}

Prior work has focused on\nlargely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple\nmechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated\nrollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a\nfoundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,\ncomplex environments."}
