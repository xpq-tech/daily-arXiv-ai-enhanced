### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了情感反应指数，结合街景图像和社交媒体文本分析北京二环2016和2022年的情感不一致性，发现感知与观点情感存在显著差异，并与建筑密度、行人存在等城市元素相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入人类感知和观点中的情感反应变化，挑战了现有城市研究中的多维情感分析方法。

Method: 构建包含140,750张街景图像和984,024条微博文本的数据集，开发反应指数，结合物体检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析基于土地利用分布。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更均匀，观点情感反应趋势图显示更极端变化。不匹配图显示感知与观点情感存在显著差异，情感变化与密集建筑、行人存在等元素显著相关。

Conclusion: 不一致图展示了疫情前后的感知和观点情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准，通过构建包含异构检索器偏见和智能体工作流级联错误的噪声长上下文，评估大语言模型的长上下文鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试忽略了现实世界中由偏见检索和智能体工作流产生的噪声上下文，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估异构检索策略对干扰项构成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验显示：更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果和减轻有害干扰；在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现LLMs在多数语言中无需微调即可达到最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性尚未得到验证，特别是在缺乏目标领域或语言训练数据的情况下。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i)在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii)使用LLMs直接进行上下文词形生成。实验涵盖12种不同形态复杂度的语言。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调时仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中仅需少量示例即可达到最先进的结果，无需事先微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，特别是在缺乏训练数据的情况下，能够直接生成词形并达到最佳性能。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，相比传统WER更关注语义而非形态句法差异，在印地语上与人标注相关性达94%，并展示小模型微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响句子语义的形态和句法差异惩罚过重，需要更语义导向的评估方法。

Method: 使用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示学习评分标准；同时展示小模型Llama 3在参考和ASR预测的词对示例上微调来预测惩罚类型。

Result: 印地语LASER使用Gemini 2.5 Pro获得94%的人标注相关性；印地语示例对其他印度语言如马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语也有效；小模型微调预测惩罚类型准确率达89%。

Conclusion: LLM-based LASER评分标准能更公平评估ASR系统，关注语义而非表面差异，且具有跨语言适用性，小模型微调也能达到良好效果。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对手语骨骼姿势评估方法的全面研究，涵盖基于关键点距离、嵌入和反向翻译的指标，通过自动元评估和人类相关性研究展示不同场景下的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为手语翻译或生成系统提供有意义且可复现的评估方法，解决现有评估标准不足的问题。

Method: 使用关键点距离、嵌入和反向翻译三种评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人类相关性研究（文本到姿势翻译）进行验证。

Result: 展示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，开发了开源姿势评估工具包。

Conclusion: 研究结果和开源工具包为开发和评估手语翻译或生成系统提供了实用且可复现的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，用于测量民粹主义的思想内容，该方法通过模仿人类编码员训练过程，使大语言模型能够达到与专家人类编码员相当的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时且难以跨语言、跨情境和大规模语料库扩展，需要一种更高效准确的替代方案。

Method: 利用全球民粹主义数据库，采用规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，通过向LLM提供与训练人类编码员相同的文档来指导模型推理过程。

Result: 该方法使LLM在民粹主义分类上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微差别和情境敏感性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的提示策略能够有效提升LLM在复杂概念分类任务中的表现，为大规模民粹主义测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过将多智能体系统提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法来解决，实现了自动化的多智能体提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化尚未充分探索。

Method: MAPRO采用四阶段框架：1)将MAS提示优化建模为MAP推理问题；2)使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解；3)采用拓扑感知的精炼机制，结合执行反馈和下游责任进行选择性更新；4)迭代收敛到协调的智能体特定提示策略。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，一致超越了手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统的性能，其基于MAP的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤来消除顺序依赖，在测试时缩放任务中实现理论最优的每token处理时间，相比现有方法减少20%以上TPOT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度token选择，在高并发和长CoT场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时序回归模块预测下一token查询状态；(2)异步分离框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环解耦，通过异步性重叠KV选择与推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上验证，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，达到理论最优TPOT。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，同时在多个TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的前提下消除了顺序依赖，为高效TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体框架来探索团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态，并在常识推理和社交推理任务上评估团队表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学启发，研究LLM驱动的多智能体系统中的团队动态，这一领域目前研究较少。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa、Latent Implicit Hate）上的表现，涵盖常识和社交推理。

Result: 扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队表现过度自信，但反思显示对合作的欣赏和整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队在结构、多样性和互动方面存在重要动态，需要进一步研究以优化团队协作效果。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出在文本空间进行推理可显著提升语音LLMs的准确性，并通过引入基于熵的问题完整性指标来减少推理延迟，最后使用DPO优化进一步提升了准确性与延迟的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，而思维链方法已被证明能显著提升文本LLMs的推理能力。此外，语音交互中的延迟问题也至关重要。

Method: 1. 对多流语音LLMs进行思维链微调；2. 引入基于熵的问题完整性指标，允许模型在用户查询结束前开始推理；3. 使用直接偏好优化在偏好数据上进一步优化准确性与延迟的权衡。

Result: 1. 思维链微调使语音LLMs在口语推理任务上的准确性平均提升2.4倍；2. 提出的延迟优化方法在相同延迟条件下，在ARC-Easy任务上获得4%的准确性提升；3. DPO优化实现了70%的延迟减少且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能有效提升语音LLMs的推理能力，结合问题完整性指标和DPO优化，可以在保持高准确性的同时显著降低推理延迟，为语音交互系统提供了更好的准确性与延迟权衡方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了思想模板框架ToTAL，通过可重用的思想缓存来指导多跳推理，解决了长上下文语言模型在处理大量文档时无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接关系，限制了多跳推理能力。

Method: 使用思想模板将推理重新构建为可重用的思想缓存，从先前的解题轨迹中提取，结构化证据组合方式，并通过自然语言反馈迭代优化模板。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线在基于检索和无检索设置下都取得了持续提升，优化后的模板可蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思想模板增强了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，展示了透明推理重用的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，该模型在多个数据集上训练，在跨领域文本上表现优异，实现了当前最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯字母和塔吉克-西里尔字母），虽然方言相似但书写差异阻碍了交流。现有模型局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 使用序列到序列模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并贡献了两个新数据集，实现了跨领域的音译能力。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04，设定了全面的基准。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了对音译任务更清晰的理解，建立了可比较的领先基准，其模型、数据和代码均已公开。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新型推测解码方法，专门针对长上下文场景，相比现有方法在长上下文输入下实现了约5倍的接受长度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K token）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，甚至导致生成速度变慢。

Method: OWL采用三种创新：1）基于LSTM的草稿器，仅依赖最后token状态实现长度泛化；2）验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]为草稿器提供更丰富表示；3）结合树形和非树形解码的混合算法。

Result: 在长上下文输入下，OWL的接受长度比EAGLE3高出约5倍，解决了现有方法在长上下文场景下的性能退化问题。

Conclusion: OWL通过专门针对长上下文设计的创新方法，显著提升了推测解码在现实工作负载中的性能，并发布了LongSpecBench基准测试和所有代码数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

<details>

Motivation: 解决小参数模型（≤2B）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器性能不佳的问题，使其能在资源受限环境中实际应用。

Method: 1. 多标准提示：将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；2. 领域自适应迁移学习：在图表数据集上使用合成判断微调2B参数LVLM，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性差距，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能有效跨数据集迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决了传统多任务预微调中的优化冲突问题，使单个共享编码器能够适应NER和文本分类任务，在移动设备上实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要既能适应多样化应用，又能在内存和计算上保持高效的模型。传统多任务预微调存在优化信号冲突问题，导致整体性能下降。

Method: 提出基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单个共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，避免不同任务间的优化冲突。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验显示，NER任务平均提升+0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升+8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当，同时满足实际部署约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为移动NLP应用提供了有效的多任务预微调解决方案，能够在保持模型效率的同时提升多任务适应性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上与真实信息存在显著差异，COVID-19错误信息具有更低的可读性和更高的恐惧相关词汇频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康错误信息与真实信息在语言特征上的差异，以帮助检测错误信息并改进公共卫生传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库（COVID-19错误信息、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关内容）进行对比分析，考察可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言的使用差异。

Result: COVID-19错误信息可读性得分明显更低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用最少，与猴痘内容的情感化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用刻意复杂的修辞风格并嵌入情感线索，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为数字健康错误信息检测提供了语言指标，但也存在使用传统可读性指数和静态分析等局限。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发人工构造语言的系统，通过模块化流程创建音系、语料库、词典、正字法和语法手册，并能进行句子翻译


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重目标：为构造人工语言提供有趣工具；探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及应用于从高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译

Method: 模块化系统：1) 代理方法创建目标音系；2) 将英语句子'翻译'为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记；3) 构建词典；4) 设计正字法；5) 编写语法手册

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范之间存在能力差异，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在低资源语言翻译方面结果多为负面，但改进版本可能带来真正收益

Conclusion: 该系统成功展示了LLMs在构造语言开发中的实用性，同时揭示了LLMs对语言学概念理解的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型输入词汇表征的结构及其在训练过程中的演化，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型的输入词汇表征如何结构化，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演化，特别是词汇嵌入几何与语言特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，关联Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入几何结构，与语义、语法和频率指标在训练过程中的相关性。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量。

Conclusion: 词汇嵌入几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹揭示了词频和功能的独特作用，激励进一步研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型训练中的特定能力增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在临床编码任务中的失败原因，发现层次结构接近但错误的编码占很大比例，提出了轻量级干预方法和临床编码验证机制，并发布了新的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的临床编码对医疗文档、计费和决策至关重要，但现有LLM在此任务上表现不佳，且基于精确匹配的评估方法忽视了层次结构接近但错误的编码问题。

Method: 采用轻量级干预方法（包括提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并创建了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 研究发现层次结构错位占LLM失败案例的很大部分，验证机制被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效可靠步骤。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进基于LLM的医疗编码的有效方法，轻量级干预可以显著提高准确性，而无需基于搜索方法的高计算开销。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究LLM在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD数据集添加PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种方法：提示、两步验证管道和LoRA微调，发现显式验证能提高拒绝精度，微调在安全性和实用性间达到更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大型语言模型经常通过生成无限制响应来模糊角色边界。需要研究LLM遵守访问控制策略的能力，即在授权时回答，未授权时拒绝。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集的新数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略。比较了三种设计：(i)零或少样本提示，(ii)检查SQL与策略的两步生成器-验证器管道，(iii)直接学习权限感知的LoRA微调模型。

Result: 在多个模型系列中，显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可。同时，微调在安全性和实用性（考虑执行准确性）之间实现了更强的平衡。更长更复杂的策略持续降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 发布RBAC增强数据集和代码，显式验证和微调是提高LLM访问控制合规性的有效方法，但复杂策略仍会降低系统可靠性。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色，无法作为主要银行界面执行核心金融交易。本文旨在开发一个获得监管批准的、能够可靠支持核心金融操作的自然语言界面。

Method: 构建完全内部的Ryt AI框架，使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ）替换刚性多屏工作流程，每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，并在银行基础设施内托管以确保一致行为。

Result: 成功部署了全球首个获得监管批准的以对话AI作为主要银行界面的系统，能够可靠支持核心金融操作。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格治理下，获得监管批准的自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，实现了"正确银行"的理念。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的长上下文窗口导致KV缓存内存开销巨大，现有缓存淘汰方法仅基于累积注意力权重进行启发式排序，未考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于Optimal Brain Damage理论推导闭式解来量化token重要性，考虑键、值和联合键值对三种情况，并整合注意力权重、值状态和注意力输出信息。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有工作的启发式分数能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的token重要性评估显著改进了长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌概率(TP)偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被批评与真实语言模型使用场景和危害脱节，因此需要测试更现实的替代方法。

Method: 使用自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，并与传统的令牌概率(TP)方法进行比较分析。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI更易检测"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感脆弱。

Conclusion: 令牌概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见评估指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估进行综合评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和复杂场景覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范问题。

Method: 使用综合分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在相互竞争的原则之间做出选择，通过价值分类分数评估12个前沿LLM的行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，实证表明高行为分歧强烈预示模型规范问题，包括直接矛盾、解释模糊性、明显错位和误报拒绝等。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别模型规范中的潜在问题，揭示了前沿LLM在价值权衡场景中的行为差异和优先级模式，为改进模型规范提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,

taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表层语言特征，难以有效泛化到不同风格变体。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能引发标签与风格间的虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为因果图，涉及环境、动机、目标和风格等关键因素。提出CADET框架，解构仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素，控制混杂变量，并在潜在空间中进行反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架能有效提升仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力，通过解构和干预风格因素来识别真实仇恨意图。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态特性的丰富时间和语义结构，导致个性化程度较浅。

Method: 构建两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆捕捉具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合了时间和语义信息但处于不同抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试中验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过层次化记忆结构成功捕捉了用户兴趣的动态演化，为深度个性化生成提供了统一表示。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个基于子问题驱动的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题序列，动态扩展知识图谱，构建可追溯的图记忆，显著提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法虽然能构建知识图谱连接分散事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序的子问题链，为每个子问题检索相关三元组，当现有图谱不足时实时从源文档提取新三元组，构建图记忆作为结构化证据路径。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG取得了一致且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 子问题驱动的图RAG框架通过增强推理深度，有效解决了复杂多跳问答中的证据不完整和错误传播问题。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多语言知识图谱补全研究未能充分利用LLMs的多语言能力，忽视了跨语言知识的可共享性。

Method: 提出KL-GMoE高效建模共享知识，IER显著增强其利用效果，构建了包含5种语言的多语言知识图谱数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效利用跨语言共享知识显著提升了多语言知识图谱补全性能，为多语言知识共享研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

TL;DR: 提出ToolExpander框架解决GRPO训练中模型响应不准确和小规模架构性能差的问题，通过动态多轮硬采样和自示例思维两大创新提升工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练大型语言模型时面临模型响应不准确、小规模架构性能差、训练中崩溃等问题，限制了性能提升和GRPO潜力。

Method: ToolExpander框架包含：(1)动态多轮硬采样-用高质量少样本演示替换困难样本，配合指数学习率衰减；(2)自示例思维-消除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，通过微小奖励(0.01)激励模型自主生成分析示例。

Result: 实验表明ToolExpander显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，同时提升了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLMs提供了更稳定高效的工具导向强化学习方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性，需要更可靠和可扩展的评分标准生成方法

Method: 引入Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG)方法，通过对比偏好和拒绝响应来推导硬规则和原则，并使用拒绝采样提高可靠性

Result: Rubric-RM在多个奖励建模基准测试中超越强基线6.8%，在指令遵循和生物医学基准上获得性能提升

Conclusion: 评分标准提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵人工评估与自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文为潜空间推理模型启用了并行测试时扩展(TTS)，通过引入两种不确定性驱动的采样策略(蒙特卡洛Dropout和高斯噪声)和设计潜奖励模型(LatentRM)来解决连续空间中的采样和轨迹聚合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜空间推理虽然比显式思维链更高效，但缺乏连续空间的采样机制和概率信号，无法像传统语言模型那样从并行TTS中受益。

Method: 提出两种不确定性采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声；设计潜奖励模型(LatentRM)通过逐步对比目标训练来评分和指导潜空间推理。

Result: 实验表明两种采样策略都能有效扩展计算能力并展现不同的探索动态，LatentRM能够实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>

Motivation: 研究LLMs在MCQA任务中的推理策略，特别是验证仅有选项输入时的成功是否真的使用了有问题的浅层策略。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅有选项输入的情况下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性测试。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅有选项情况下提高准确率；仅有选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响，且推理轨迹通过了忠实性测试，表明使用了推断缺失问题等较少问题的策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功不一定总是缺陷，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了基于结果奖励的数学推理模型容易产生奖励欺骗，导致高估模型推理能力。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，通过评估整个推理轨迹来提升模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于最终答案的奖励机制容易导致奖励欺骗，产生大量通过错误推理过程得到正确答案的假阳性案例，严重高估模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 引入Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，根据问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励(0-1分)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的强化学习训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督方法。在AIME2024上将Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升至62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率降低71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要，过程导向的奖励机制能有效缓解奖励欺骗问题。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Conclusion: 通过特征解耦和子空间正交化可以同时保持LLM的真实性和安全对齐能力，解决两者之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Conclusion: 该方法通过端到端的联合学习方式有效解决了少样本多标签意图检测中的错误传播问题

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可理解为可控的平衡现象而非必然衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝时通常只使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合校准集，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性（范数和内积），同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。设计了方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对主方向影响大的维度。

Conclusion: 结合旋转约束更新和方差感知评分的方法能有效补偿误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and

Result: 在7个多样化QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型分别达到65.4%(3B)和67.2%(7B)的平均准确率，同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%并降低搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG证明了通过RL进行细粒度控制对于改进搜索代理推理效率和最优性的重要性和潜力，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑合成过程，有效解决了多智能体系统通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题，为LLM驱动的多智能体系统提供了更优的通信架构。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符不对齐和标识符膨胀两大挑战。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义，压缩标识符空间，并采用动态多步约束解码策略。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成式检索的核心问题，在提升准确率的同时显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决了现有方法在训练-推理一致性和监督质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 小型语言模型在严格延迟和计算约束应用中很重要，但实现高性能具有挑战性。现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成。让学生先探索自己的预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性地整合教师指导，同时保持一致性和监督质量。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小型语言模型提供了实用有效的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch通过动态切换策略，有效解决了知识蒸馏中的一致性与质量权衡问题，为小型语言模型的性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为解决LLM翻译中的质量和公平性问题提供了系统性的评估工具和数据支持。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使是简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，导致计算效率低下。现有研究对过度思考的根本原因理解不足。

Method: 开发了TRACE系统：首先将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维，然后推断子思维间的话语关系，构建细粒度思维进展图，识别相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现开放权重思维模型主要有两种模式——探索者和晚期着陆，证实过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢5-20倍但无准确率提升。

Conclusion: 提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了传统的基于长度的度量，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性管理过度思考提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果证实了一致的改进，展示了ConG的通用性和有效性

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化方法，为通向通用人工智能提供有前景的路径

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究标准语到方言的迁移在不同模态下的效果

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型和语音转录后文本处理的级联系统

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最佳，级联系统在德语上落后于纯文本模型，但在方言数据上如果转录系统生成标准化输出则表现相对较好

Conclusion: 语音模型在处理方言数据方面具有优势，而级联系统在特定条件下也能在方言任务中取得不错效果

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench提供了一个客观、确定性和可代码验证的框架，用于系统评估LLMs遵循详细指令执行复杂任务的能力。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现不佳，特别是在涉及推理链中隐含中间主题时性能衰减严重。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐含主题作为查询神经元，在Transformer层中顺序激活对应的值神经元来积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键的查询-值通路。

Result: 在GPT-J上比最先进方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，显示值神经元的语义可解释性由查询驱动的积累过程协调。

Conclusion: 这些发现基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and

However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动化评估策略：1）基于NLI的方法，将文本分解为原子陈述并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；2）基于问答的方法，提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；3）端到端方法，直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本完整性方面效果最佳，但需要权衡鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测歧义问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励优化模型，在多个开放域问答基准上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模型在处理允许多个有效答案的歧义问题时表现不佳，标准问答基准通常假设单一正确答案，产生不合适的训练信号，而现有处理歧义的方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 使用自动化流程检测歧义问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励通过强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在8个开放域问答基准测试中，A²Search-7B在4个多跳基准上的平均AnsF1@1得分为48.4%，优于包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）在内的所有强基线。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决歧义并在不同基准间泛化，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)与大型语言模型(LLM)的行为差异来识别关键推理时刻，通过专家-业余对比构建监督样本，显著提升LLM推理能力且大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有学习价值。本文探索能否利用小型语言模型揭示大型语言模型的高价值推理时刻。

Method: LightReasoner框架包含两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为对比识别关键推理时刻，构建捕捉专家优势的监督样本；(2)微调阶段：使用这些蒸馏样本对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型语言模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法来推进大型语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中表现不佳，存在认知混淆和逻辑不一致问题。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升了社交推理准确性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却遇到困难，表现出认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态的混淆问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监测推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，该机制显著提高了准确性（例如在Hi-ToM中提升10%），同时降低了计算成本（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，模仿了人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表标题需要同时保证准确性和风格一致性，现有方法难以兼顾这两方面需求。

Method: 两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用上下文过滤、类别特定提示优化和候选标题选择；第二阶段通过少量样本提示和作者档案进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本方法提升ROUGE-1召回率8.3%，风格精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适配能够生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在部署到现实世界长期任务时存在关键限制：它们是测试时静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏积累知识和持续改进的能力。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，围绕分层记忆模块构建经验驱动的自进化系统。代理在每个子任务执行后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合到记忆模块中。

Result: 在长期生产力基准TAC上取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型。随着经验积累，代理展现出越来越优越的任务完成能力以及稳健的持续学习和自进化能力。

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理新范式，积累的经验展现出强大的泛化特性，能够零样本改进新任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能够编码非平凡的气候结构，但在山区和高纬度地区存在空间一致误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性评估和错误信息风险分析至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态参数知识的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，要求模型回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，提供坐标和位置描述符，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差为±1°C，但在1500米以上海拔性能急剧下降。包含地理背景可减少27%误差，大型模型对位置描述符最敏感。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕捉当前气候分布，但无法准确表示长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要。该评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future

Result: 实验结果表明FedDTRE能够提升对话模型性能，改善对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估机制有效解决了联邦学习中过拟合和全局信息遗忘的问题，为对话生成系统提供了更好的隐私保护与个性化平衡方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，比较在有/无LLM生成的PRO和CON论证时的评分变化

Result: 人类在PRO论证存在时平均合理性评分增加，在CON论证存在时评分降低；LLM表现出类似的影响模式

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也存在实际担忧：即使在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM也可能对人们的信念产生显著影响

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Motivation: 谈判是AI智能体的基本挑战，需要战略推理、对手建模以及合作与竞争的平衡能力。本研究旨在系统评估推理对LLM谈判能力的影响。

Method: 使用自博弈设置，在三种不同的对话游戏中评估商业和开源LLM的谈判能力，分析性能与成本的权衡、推理过程的语言一致性以及模型的战略适应性。

Result: 推理显著改善了谈判结果，GPT-5性能提升31.4%，但成本增加近400%。开源模型在德语或意大利语谈判时仍使用英语进行内部推理，而商业模型能保持语言一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能有效提升LLM的谈判能力，但成本高昂；多语言推理存在显著差异，开源模型的语言不一致性可能影响通过推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过最大共同词汇将给定自回归语言模型高效转换为任意小词汇量的模型。

Result: 实现了语言模型的无损词汇缩减，使不同分词方式的模型能够通过最大共同词汇进行高效协作。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架解决了不同分词模型间的协作问题，为模型集成和跨模型合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理常见错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模使用来替代人工标注，需要理解其潜在的偏见和风险。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个标准内容危害检测数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM评判者的决策具有高保真度，并对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度良好，该方法能有效揭示LLM评判者的决策模式。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

TL;DR: Genii是一个无监督的多智能体协作优化框架，通过模拟客户端-服务器轮询机制来减轻LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自己生成的回答，这降低了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制，无监督地优化每个客户端智能体。

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注。在不同客户端智能体的轮询过程中性能持续提升，即使使用较弱的模型作为服务器智能体。

Conclusion: Genii有效减轻了基于LLM的评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这影响了模型的实用性和用户体验。

Method: 引入两个基准测试：单轮提示的XSB和多轮对话的MS-XSB；使用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发词；部署三种模型无关的轻量级方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验显示这些策略显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护；过度拒绝问题在复杂的多轮场景中尤为明显。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的诊断和缓解过度拒绝的框架，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: ARM2采用强化学习框架，通过长度感知优化自适应平衡推理性能与效率，集成视觉理解和可执行代码，支持多模态推理。

Result: 实验表明ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2有效解决了推理模型的效率问题，通过自适应推理机制在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为多模态推理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过格律诗的视角，为理解当代LLMs的能力和局限性提供了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

TL;DR: 提出了函数令牌假说来解释大语言模型的工作机制：在推理过程中，函数令牌激活上下文中最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测（记忆检索）；在预训练过程中，预测函数令牌后的内容令牌会增加模型学习到的特征数量并更新参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令遵循和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍然缺乏深入理解。本文旨在揭示LLMs内部工作机制，特别是记忆操作的过程。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，通过二分图分析证明少数函数令牌激活了大部分特征，并通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测。

Result: 实验证据表明，少量函数令牌确实激活了大部分特征；预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导，这迫使函数令牌选择上下文中最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新的理论框架，揭示了函数令牌在模型推理和训练中的核心作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽视反因果关系的问题，并证明整合反因果声明能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果提取数据集只关注支持关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽视或错误标注反驳关系的"反因果"声明，这限制了因果推理的完整性。

Method: 通过文献综述建立理论框架，制定严格的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上扩充反因果声明，获得高标注一致性(Cohen's κ=0.74)。

Result: 实验表明，未训练反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果错误分类为正因果，而基于新数据集的训练能有效提升transformer模型区分正反因果的能力。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于完整的因果推理至关重要，新数据集能显著改善模型对因果关系的理解能力，避免错误分类。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%）。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过对话和反馈智能体的共同进化和自适应反馈应用，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强LLM安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 使用对比解码生成合成数据与真实数据混合训练，能提升语言建模和下游任务性能，其中对比解码的合成数据对推理任务帮助更大，传统采样数据对语言表层能力任务更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练数据可能面临枯竭，需要探索使用模型生成的合成数据作为补充训练数据源

Method: 在受控环境中，使用好模型和差模型之间的相对差异进行对比解码来生成合成语料库，然后将合成数据与原始训练数据混合进行训练

Result: 混合合成数据和真实数据进行训练能提升语言建模目标和下游任务性能，对比解码的合成数据对推理任务帮助更大，传统采样数据对语言表层能力任务更有效

Conclusion: 对比解码生成的合成数据是有效的训练数据补充，特别适合提升模型的推理能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索智能体基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在多轮长时交互中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理问题。

Method: 提出反向构造方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略使用滑动窗口机制，无需外部摘要模型。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: DeepMiner有效解决了现有多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，支持近100轮的持续交互，显著提升了多轮智能体的深度推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，它们集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对一般自然语言理解影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解变得重要。然而，LLMs存在文化偏见和对少数文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确识别文化相关神经元。识别了文化通用神经元（对所有文化理解都有贡献）和文化特定神经元（与单个文化相关）。

Result: 识别出的文化相关神经元仅占所有神经元的不到1%，集中在浅层到中层MLP层。抑制这些神经元使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，但对一般NLU基准测试影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs内部文化理解机制，为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。发现NLU基准训练可能削弱模型的文化理解能力，当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式对抗提示生成方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）通过反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。引入验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示危害性。

Result: 构建了两个红队数据集（AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard），在8个最先进LLM上评估，相比现有基线实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队方法在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力，将开源数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，结合轻量BERT处理显性案例和多视角LLM投票处理隐性案例，平衡效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀率上升需要主动预防策略，社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测隐性自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺等间接表达）极具挑战性。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段轻量BERT分类器处理高置信度显性案例；第二阶段模糊输入升级到多视角LLM投票框架或基于心理学指标的ML集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：显性案例F1达98.0%，隐性案例F1达99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率与鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理学特征作为结构化向量用于此任务的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示和学习两个维度的独立性，发现演示的表示质量决定ICL的基线准确率，而学习能力则独立于表示质量，能够在任何表示基础上通过增加演示数量提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示方式的影响，但对ICL的学习能力观察结果不一。本文旨在探究表示和学习这两个维度在ICL中的交互关系，验证它们是否相互独立。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集表示，然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验，分析学习效果与表示质量的关系。

Result: 学习确实发生在所有标签集上，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的影响。表示质量决定的相对准确率排名在学习过程中基本保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习效应是相互独立的，表示质量决定性能基线，学习能力则独立于表示质量而存在，这一发现揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，对其条件语句可接受性判断的研究仍不清楚。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，比较不同模型家族、大小和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索的一致性不如人类；更大的模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义信息，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是决定与人类判断一致性的关键因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Result: 在10M tokens上训练2个epoch即超越GPT-2(124M)和GPT-BERT(30M)训练10个epoch的性能，在SuperGLUE任务中零样本和微调表现优异。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考主流深度学习范式和扩展定律，小规模高效模型具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效解决了MLRMs推理努力分配不平衡的问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: LEWIDI作为一个框架得到加强，为新资源、基准和发现提供了支持，促进了分歧感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行推理方法在LLMs中产生大量冗余推理轨迹（超过80%的轨迹产生相同答案），造成显著计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1）使用焦点损失和过采样训练的法官模型预测答案等价性；2）在线贪心聚类算法动态剪枝冗余路径。

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA基准测试中，相比传统共识采样减少80%以上token消耗，准确率仅下降3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 人类在有新概念需求时会发明新词，作者希望验证类似方法在LLM通信中的有效性，通过引入新词来增强对模型的理解和控制能力。

Method: 通过添加新的词嵌入并训练展示该概念的示例，不改变其他模型参数，引入新词来表示特定概念，并让模型自我解释新词含义。

Conclusion: 新词学习是理解和控制LLM的有效方法，通过自我解释和插件评估验证了其有效性，展示了多概念联合学习的潜力。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a

Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Method: 使用强化学习框架直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量的关系，识别推理关键头，对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，该方法在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近未压缩结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KV头在推理模型中具有功能异质性，RLKV能有效识别推理关键头，实现高效的KV缓存压缩而不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个新型的多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的相互讨论和协作实现自主进化，无需外部监督，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的自我进化方法要么依赖外部奖励信号，要么从LLM自身提取内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作进行学习的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS通过智能体间丰富的讨论动态生成内在奖励，采用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果表明CoMAS始终优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自我进化建立了一个新颖有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来应对预训练数据泄露问题，保持基准测试的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据泄露导致基准测试失效，模型通过记忆而非真正泛化来获得高分，扭曲了模型比较和进展评估。

Method: 框架通过推断测试案例核心能力、生成保持原始目标的候选问答对、使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图、聚合多个模型反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例，通过上下文演示迭代生成更具挑战性的诊断案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，增加难度同时保持测试目标一致性，并提高模型区分度。

Conclusion: 该框架为持续进化基准测试提供了可扩展路径，能够跟上基础模型的快速发展步伐。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的幻觉问题，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学的约束语义学，在解码时使用语义防护网格，包含局部似然优势证明、知识感知安全质量熵不变性，以及多智能体操作演算。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，该方法在不牺牲吞吐量的情况下有效减少幻觉，为大规模经验模型与形式验证提供了实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD 成功构建了神经语言生成与知识库对齐的验证框架，通过形式化方法实现了幻觉减少与性能平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的普及使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御无法应对的复杂多阶段攻击，需要具备上下文感知能力的智能防御方案。

Method: 提出L2M-AID框架，利用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转化为上下文感知状态表示，结合多智能体强化学习(MAPPO)学习协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作需求。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK的合成数据集上测试，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了强大的新范式，通过LLM与多智能体强化学习的深度融合实现自适应和弹性安全防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型为何优于基础模型，明确其是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法来发现思考模型中的人类可解释推理行为。

Result: 在三个基础模型和四个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时间高效部署这些机制，实现推理计算的高效利用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断存在能力限制，需要更个性化和连续的评估方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁的低水平经验采样，促进诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化护理框架。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者数据采样，为动态适应个体需求和病情变化提供可能，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康数字孪生框架有潜力变革个性化心理健康护理，需要进一步研究来完善和实施该框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测模型如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式结合，限制了其空间建模能力。需要开发能够同时考虑物理拓扑和数据特征相似性的方法。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合，并采用战略性专家选择策略。

Result: 在METR LA数据集上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），PEMS BAY数据集上提升4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）。最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但战略性设计的专家比复杂的多专家集成表现更好，实现了新的最先进性能，同时具有优异的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，经常出现幻觉或知识泄漏问题，需要专门设计来改善这些缺陷。

Method: 使用原子操作符直接与原始数值序列交互，记录证据日志，通过自批判和质量门控迭代优化推理过程，避免将时间序列转换为文本、图像或嵌入。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到与最先进LLMs相当的性能，在推理任务上显著提升，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过严格分工的设计，有效解决了LLMs在时间序列推理中的局限性，提供了可解释且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Method: 使用多个LLM（包括ChatGPT模型o3）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，通过自然语言界面进行交互式对话，分析语法、逻辑和语义层面的问题。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型图像，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答问题。不同LLM在性能和效果上存在差异，但总体上可作为业务流程设计的有效助手。

Conclusion: LLM在业务流程模型理解方面表现出色，具有作为设计助手的价值，并展现出类人化的推理特性，能够在流程分析和优化中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach

Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含两阶段流程：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力引入地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练、参数调优的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告等系统性缺陷，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，迫切需要建立统一可信的评估范式来确保AI发展的可持续性。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理的监考评估模式，包含密封执行、题库银行滚动更新、延迟透明度等核心机制。

Result: 构建了一个能够系统性解决当前评估缺陷的蓝图，为建立真正可信的AI进展衡量标准奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方法不可持续，必须转向统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架，PeerBench为此提供了可行的实现路径。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递时插入必要的问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望提升问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会在整个链中传播）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从精选的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何提问；(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提升公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了实证改进外，该研究贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的序列多智能体系统在处理复杂软件任务时存在错误传递问题，难以追踪和问责，需要建立可信任的系统架构。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic三阶段流水线，评估8种配置的三种先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化问责交接显著提高准确性；模型在不同角色中表现各异；准确性-成本-延迟权衡具有任务依赖性，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明前沿AI模型在组合推理基准上表现不佳，甚至低于随机水平，但作者认为这可能是由于评估指标的系统性低估造成的。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 该方法使SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现，在16个数据集变体上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，AI模型在组合推理方面的隐藏能力被充分释放，推动了组合推理研究的前沿。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG)方法，通过高置信度离策略评估保证推荐系统在探索新物品时的安全性，并进一步开发了DEPLOY框架来平衡安全性和探索性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实推荐系统中，新物品会频繁添加，现有离策略学习方法在存在新物品时可能不安全，需要开发既能保证安全又能探索新物品的框架。

Method: 首先开发了Safe OPG方法，基于高置信度离策略评估实现模型无关的安全离策略学习；然后提出了DEPLOY框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化。

Result: 实验显示Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPLOY框架能够在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了推荐系统中安全性和探索性之间的权衡问题，实现了既能保证安全又能探索新物品的推荐系统部署。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可复现的模拟框架来评估多模态环境中生成代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在检测多模态矛盾方面表现有限，仅55%成功修正不安全计划，且45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但其在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 引入可复现模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知和社会度量工具SocialMetrics，评估代理在安全改进、不安全活动检测和社会动态三个维度的表现。

Result: 实验显示代理在多模态矛盾检测方面表现有限，不安全到安全转换率分别为Claude 75%、GPT-4o mini 55%、Qwen-VL 58%，总体性能从多风险场景的20%到局部场景的98%不等，45%不安全行为在误导视觉下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，过度信任图像是主要问题，该框架为研究多模态安全、连贯性和社会动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，通过持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的量化距离，从而产生反映瞬时状态动态的奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将STL奖励函数融入强化学习，但自动推断的奖励代表全局评估而非局部变化的累积，稀疏的全局奖励可能导致不收敛和不稳定的训练性能。

Method: 在线奖励生成方法，通过在线因果监控STL规范，在每个控制步骤计算满足或违反的量化距离，并提供因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性，使其适用于深度强化学习方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中对多种连续控制基准进行评估，实验结果表明该方法优于现有的相关STL引导RL方法，为深度RL提供了更稳健高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 提出的基于STL在线因果语义的RL方法能够提供更精确的局部奖励信号，改善训练收敛性和稳定性，在控制合成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步反应路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000多个标注的机理步骤；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分；分析前沿LLM性能，并探索提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难；使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严谨基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合层次化引用图来生成更全面和结构化的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的综述生成方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容进行总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，构建三层层次化引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合层内水平搜索和跨层垂直深度遍历，生成多级摘要并整合为结构化综述大纲，最后通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖率和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中都优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合层次化引用图结构，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，在结构连贯性和内容深度方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在医疗领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为医疗是高风险领域，错误不可接受。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信、透明且经济高效AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了ACONIC框架，通过将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式复杂度度量来指导分解，以解决LLM在复杂任务中的可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有的分解方法都是启发式的，依赖于智能体或手动分解。

Method: 引入ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂度度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过基于复杂度的分解，智能体性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架提供了一种系统化的任务分解方法，能够有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等算法在模型无法解决问题时缺乏正确更新方向的问题，提高了训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型rollout响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识。当模型无法解决问题时，缺乏正确的更新方向。

Method: 引入Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)，在模型无法解决问题时，使用外部标准参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确准确的更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过引入外部参考答案，有效解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和推理泛化能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出SHADOW框架，通过强化学习在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险，实现更高的追捕成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗环境中信息获取与暴露风险之间的战略权衡，探索追捕者如何在获取逃逸者位置信息的同时避免自身位置暴露的风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈框架和SHADOW多头部序列强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率，消融研究证实时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了SHADOW框架的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配和局部导航代理的协同优化，在城市规模交通网络中显著提升出行效率和缓解拥堵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协同推理优化机制和双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个不同规模的真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种基准方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示和缺乏可解释性等局限，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果测试推断有向因果图，学生代理细化图结构并基于高置信度因果关联进行微调预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur实现了有竞争力的性能，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，在保持预测准确性的同时提供了透明可追溯的变量交互推理，为时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估深度研究系统提供了全面框架，支持系统化能力比较，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Motivation: AI系统在政府服务中常产生偏见或不正确输出，减少公民和公务员的决策参与权。现有透明度实践主要关注技术对象，难以让公众理解且缺乏行动指导。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展面向公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应连接理解与行动潜力，让公众能够参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义的透明度是解决公民AI系统问题的关键，需要超越技术层面，关注社会物质背景和公众参与能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理存在信息泄露问题，导致回测收益高但实际表现差，需要解决这一"利润幻象"问题。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动强制模型学习因果驱动。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有基线方法中表现最佳，在样本外泛化方面具有优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升了模型的真实交易能力。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供指导，并突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM智能体的适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [137] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 语言模型在数值表示上存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管能高精度重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与数值输入空间正交，且精度增加时重建效果和解释方差都会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正将连续数值建模为连续空间，以及它们在数值表示中的潜在问题。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI等模型的数值嵌入空间特性。

Result: 虽然数值重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，且随着小数精度增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型的数值表示存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号数值的应用具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段施加不同的熵约束来控制大型推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时显著减少冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，这会增加推理成本并降低可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度探索以保持灵活性，实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时保持竞争力的准确率，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 阶段熵感知的奖励机制为平衡推理模型的简洁性和性能提供了有效方法，无需依赖显式长度目标或刚性截断规则。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力模块中W^Q和W^V矩阵的功能差异进行非对称初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛缓慢的问题。研究发现自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性，源于它们的功能差异。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：向W^Q注入主成分以保留任务自适应能力，向W^V注入次要成分以保留通用特征表示，从而更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色。

Result: 该方法能够更好地平衡模型性能和参数效率，提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: 通过利用W^Q和W^V矩阵的功能差异进行非对称初始化，AILoRA有效解决了LoRA的性能次优和收敛缓慢问题，实现了更好的参数高效微调效果。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保车辆动态交互和输入描述与生成场景的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡命令遵循准确性和真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，限制在2D或非交互式模拟中。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言和闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim框架能够创建高保真场景，增强安全测试和训练，有效弥合自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有保形选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足实际多条件选择需求。

Method: 提出多条件保形选择(MCCS)算法，为合取条件引入具有区域单调性的新型非保形分数，为析取条件使用全局Benjamini-Hochberg(BH)程序。

Result: 实验验证MCCS优于基线方法，在不同条件组合、现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法在多条件环境中实现了严格的FDR控制选择，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，专注于在线评论质量评估，通过模拟人类研究过程实现特征假设生成和操作化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual框架模拟人类研究过程：通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。该框架将数据中嵌入的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算的特征。

Result: 在拥有亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，大规模A/B测试证实其有效性：每用户平均查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估中的可扩展性和可解释性问题，证明了将隐性知识转化为显性特征的可行性，为其他领域提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统移除敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，需要一种能系统移除所有敏感信息及其代理的数学基础方法

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理，构建sigma代数G捕获偏见模式结构，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示

Result: 该方法保证真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平性

Conclusion: 开发了一个可认证且数学基础扎实的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止系统无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过检查语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定对齐，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，以确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成，在保持对话质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中延迟与质量的根本矛盾：轻量模型延迟低但知识不足，工具增强代理知识丰富但同步执行导致延迟过高。

Method: 采用三组件架构：知识充分性评估器（实时评估）、轻量响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现异步知识编排。

Result: 在TopiOCQA数据集上，PMFR实现95.3%延迟降低（23.38s→1.09s），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过时间解耦框架成功解决了延迟与质量的权衡问题，为开放域对话系统提供了高效的知识访问方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，导致对大型推理模型评估不完整。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准，并利用该基准数据通过带验证奖励的强化学习训练模型。

Result: 评估发现最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理中性能显著下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。使用R-HORIZON数据训练的模型在长视野推理任务上表现大幅提升，在标准推理任务上准确率提高7.5分。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公众代理权。虽然语言、视觉和编码的能力基准很常见，但缺乏可公开审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，从公共工件和独立评估中编码可验证的实践，明确处理"未知"证据。

Result: 报告了试点提供商结果，将AIPI与相邻的透明度、安全和治理框架进行对比，展示了工具的可靠性和实用性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施向多元实践发展，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Result: TTM将偏好建模的维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，最小化认知努力，确保一致性，并与经典卡片方法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度。

Conclusion: TTM是一个实用的两两比较框架，显著降低了认知负荷和计算复杂度，同时确保一致性，已开发基于web的工具展示其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过自主干预学习因果结构的方法有效，DODO算法在因果发现任务中表现出色，为AI因果理解能力提供了可行方案

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使经过大规模预训练和后训练，仍无法可靠地进行推理。作者希望从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，为解决推理挑战提供见解。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新技术，参数减少8倍的情况下性能提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并引入潜在变量反馈的SR²框架，能够有效学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系，显著提升推理任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，攻击成功率接近完美，同时意外提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发了严重担忧，需要揭示这类智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: 设计了Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)多步后门攻击，使用有序触发序列，初始触发后从环境中获取后续触发，实现多步操纵以偏离原任务。

Result: CoTri实现了接近完美的攻击成功率(ASR)和接近零的误触发率(FTR)，同时由于训练数据建模了环境的随机性，反而提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: CoTri能够在智能体中实现稳定的多步控制，同时提高其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，存在潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在互操作性、交互协作和知识共享三个核心维度面临的挑战，为构建高效、可扩展的智能多智能体应用提供工程基础和理论指导。

Conclusion: Co-TAP协议框架为构建下一代高效、可扩展、智能的多智能体应用提供了坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Motivation: 通过利用优化问题之间的共享结构，加速相关优化问题的求解过程。

Method: 使用尺度等变图元网络(ScaleGMNs)直接在权重空间操作，实现现有模型的单次微调。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，理论分析显示卷积神经网络中的缩放对称性诱导的规范自由度比多层感知机更小。

Conclusion: 对称感知的元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大语言模型的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性而非修正性，并提出基于候选答案的动态截断方法以减少推理token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究反思在语言模型推理能力提升中的实际作用，以及如何提高推理过程的效率。

Method: 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出基于候选答案的早期停止方法。

Result: 反思主要是确认性行为，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数主要提升首次答案正确率；动态截断方法可减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理中作用有限，通过动态截断可显著提高推理效率，为优化语言模型推理过程提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Pass@k指标在大采样预算下会高估基础模型的能力，因为离散答案空间中的随机猜测会提高成功率，这不能反映真实的推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，测量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值来区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型时，流行算法的相对排名与Pass@1相比发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地衡量语言模型的推理边界，避免随机猜测的干扰，为模型评估提供更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者调研成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者提供了替代方案，但直接获取数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: 语义相似度评分方法：从LLM获取文本回复，通过嵌入相似度将这些回复映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调研数据集上测试，SSR达到人类测试-重测可靠性的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调研指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在困难，基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔，但仍面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理，通过多步决策过程进行交互式推理和检索，使用强化学习训练以最大化检索质量。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现优异，可作为即插即用模块在实际系统中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent框架通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，解决了传统RAG的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 检测大语言模型中的幻觉对其可信部署至关重要，现有基于不确定性的检测框架存在局限性，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 通过测量从多个模型输出和不同层导出的隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的见解。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实际效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 使用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标进行视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground、VQA)上表现出竞争性或优于多模态基线的性能。动态门控发现可解释模式，为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能，但挑战约束存在信息瓶颈和训练不稳定性等局限性。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在通用编程任务中表现出色，但在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，由于缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，且现有方法无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自我演进能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 提出AutoMLGen，集成领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自我演进和协作学习。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和MCGS，有效解决了机器学习工程任务中的挑战，显著提升了稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs在信息收集过程中知道何时停止，提高了医疗诊断和数学问题解决中的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集相关信息，然后才执行任务。策略性信息收集要求模型不仅知道如何有效获取信息，还要知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策，以避免过度思考或在行动时偏离正轨。

Method: CaRT使用反事实轨迹对来微调LLMs，其中一个轨迹在适当的时候终止，另一个是相同轨迹的轻微修改版本，在不适当的时候终止。它通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的理由，并将这种能力通过微调注入基础LLM中。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集的效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法通过反事实训练和语言推理，有效教会了LLMs在信息收集过程中何时停止，从而提高了任务执行效率。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured

of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel

outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

Conclusion: 早期经验范式能够显著提升智能体性能，为从模仿学习向完全经验驱动智能体的过渡提供了可行的中间路径，在多个环境和模型家族中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调新技能时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，探索如何在获得新能力的同时保持原有任务的性能。

Method: 在三个模型家族上进行五个目标技能的顺序微调，监控八个保留基准测试的性能变化，通过输出令牌分布分析遗忘机制，并测试两种选择性更新策略。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段会部分恢复，识别出输出令牌分布偏移是遗忘的关键指标，提出的两种选择性更新方法能在获得强目标增益的同时有效保留原有性能。

Conclusion: 通过有选择地更新模型特定层（自注意力投影层或MLP Gate&Up层），可以实现新技能的有效学习，同时最小化对原有能力的负面影响。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件，证明当前基于功利主义代理基准的方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来评估LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，无法实现真正的C1全局工作空间功能和C2元认知能力。

Method: 通过本体论和数学分析，提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。从经验分析和理论证明了隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上不同于符号流和训练语料库。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制，其中包含认知内容。证明了imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱。

Conclusion: 真正的C1自我意识工作空间是构建安全、元认知C2系统的必要基础，而人类是最高智能善的体现。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.
