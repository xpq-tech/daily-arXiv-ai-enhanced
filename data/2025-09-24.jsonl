They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on\ntheir own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,\nAnthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to\nstate-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data\nprivacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating\ncosts have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This\npaper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations\ndetermine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared\nto commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,\noperational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source\nmodels, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost\nof deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription\nfee.

Within this framework, we formalize a generative\ndefinition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a\nconcept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of\n$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field\nTheory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and\nconstructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks\nmutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or\neventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the\nevolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,\nculminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large\nlanguage models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition."}

Moreover, an important question arises:\nhow much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?\nAutonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task\ndecomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can\nautonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,\nreason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and\nexecute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,\nDataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to\ndiverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a\nparadigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are\ncapable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,\ntransformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and\nretrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and\nunstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why\nthe convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a\ncritical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their\narchitectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and\ncapabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance\naction workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,\nsafeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy\nDataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions."}

They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the\nbuilding lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a\nspecialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this\nchallenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed\nto quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.\nThe benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level\ncognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,\nUnderstanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were\nderived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to\nspecialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset\nencompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted\nprimarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.\nFurthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable\nand consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses\nleveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear\nperformance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite\ndemonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization\nand Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,\nparticularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing\ncomplex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.\nConsequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and\ndevelopment aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into\nsafety-critical engineering practices."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

Existing methods often fail to balance\noversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity\n(missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in\nsafety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive\nDecoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that\ndynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe\noperates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights\ntokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised\nimages, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates\nscene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according\nto the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM\narchitectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity,\noversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe\nconsistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving\nmodel helpfulness."}

Although some work has\nexplored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using\nalignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense\nreasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities\ncoexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded\ncommonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate\nlightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and\ndemonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised\nfine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12\nculture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by\n10\\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that\nout-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or\nsurpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural\ncommonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate\nthat efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising\napproach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings."}

These models\noutperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep-\nresentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done\namongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two\nvariations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task\nrelated to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks\nfrom Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges\n(n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication\nEvent Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured\nEHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs.\nThe goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting\ncontextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using\ndata driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED\nto perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and\nmulti-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods\nare also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied\nmodels. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on\nconstructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics\nincluding recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models\npre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and\nmedication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to\nbe the most effective for classifying the context of events related to\nmedications."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}
