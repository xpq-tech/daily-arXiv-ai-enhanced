Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between\nthese agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across\nvarious environmental configurations.

To overcome these limitations, we propose\n\\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into\nstructured representations optimized for reasoning.

We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging\nmemory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by\ndesign. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new\npiece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce\ninterference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We\nevaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and\nparameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks.

Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems\nfrom the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens\ndifficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we\ndesign two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in\ngenerating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer\nconditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods.

These texts hold immense potential for\nadvancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their\nunstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts\nmake automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements\nin natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as\nequally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across\nclinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively\ngeneralize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation.

Central to our\napproach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in\nsemantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops\nof the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct\ncleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.\nExperiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +\nLlama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside\nreduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view\nhead specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop\nreasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is\naccepted."}

Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on\ngrounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance\nof machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference\ntranslations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using\nsegment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to\nevaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by\nturn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in\norder than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human\nlanguages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this\nevaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to\nvalidate our reference-free metric under data scarcity.

We study one simple setting in which\ntruth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements\nco-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model\nto learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We\ncorroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.\nFinally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks\nfirst memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a\nlonger horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn\nlowers language-modeling loss.

First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in\nDLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic\nbehaviour.
