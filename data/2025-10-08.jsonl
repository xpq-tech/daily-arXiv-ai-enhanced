Considering the impressive\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive\nplanning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective\ngoal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented\nconversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to\ndialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate\ninformation in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part\ninformational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating\nintermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational\ncomponents corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible\nconfigurations for these informational components lead to limited information\nstates. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information\nstates and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.\nEventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is\nimplemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database\nqueries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of\nretrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables\npassing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of\ncongruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,\nwith no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and\nsuccess, and improvement compared with previous methods."}

Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies\nbetween local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these\nissues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer\napproach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global\nReview stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a\nScene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a\nHierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates\nstructural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task\nflow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining\ncontextual consistency.

This paper presents a controlled empirical\nstudy examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when\ntrained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model\nsuite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after\none to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from\n0-50\\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to\n20\\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\\%; larger models\n(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models\n(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early\nwarning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading\nfaster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find\nthat current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct\nsystems that maintain greater than 80\\% external data, operate well within safe\nregimes identified by our experiments.

A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

Investigating Robustness of Guardrails under RAG-style Contexts", "comment": null, "summary": "With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the\nsafety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based\nguardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and\noutputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are\nvulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval\nAugmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust\nLLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the\ncontext. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss\nmodels, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context\nalters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of\ncases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each\ncomponent in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and\nLLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor\nimprovements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current\nguardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to\nretrieval and query composition."}

This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths.

Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI."}

In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a\nunion-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight\nmatrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected\ndictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant\nbasis.

Additionally, the same scheme is used to present\nthe findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.\nAmong the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated\ntext is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by\nthe increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower\nreliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to\nfeature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive\ntext. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data\nand mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for\nbroader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors\nalso fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for\nfuture studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation\nphase."}

The success of LCMs\ncan be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information\nwithin the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals\nthat LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,\nthat can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained\nanalysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated\nGradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the\ncontext. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context\nnoise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and\nbenefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context\nDenoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy\nthat improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on\nmodel predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context\nwindow scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority\nof CDT.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate\ngenerator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all\nother candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this\nsmall model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,\ntopic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other\nintrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within\n0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is\nmeasured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model\non the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and\nevaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only\nmetric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data."}

In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we\nfind that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer).

This paper investigates the\nDunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to\noverestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By\nanalyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming\nlanguages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,\nespecially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains.

Agentic systems offer a promising\nalternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain\ntraining-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of\nmulti-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow\nagentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,\ngenerator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside\nthe multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose\nFlow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn\noptimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It\nbroadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align\nlocal planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with\ngroup-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale\nbackbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of\n14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on\nscientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.\nFurther analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing\nimproved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with\nmodel size and reasoning turns."}

Recent works have\nproposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for\nmanual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving\nsimilar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require\ncomputationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task\ndomain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled\nvalidation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)\nreasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting\nthat the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further\ninvestigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design\nthat pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which\ncan be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned\nmeta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually\ndesigned MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods.

This study investigates the\nfeasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,\ncross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,\ndata-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,\nlearning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training\nset to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic\nRegression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,\nmultimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,\nuseful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a\nPR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear \"evidentiary\ntransition,\" in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the\nstatic context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work\nestablishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality\nprediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,\ncontributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound\ndefinition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine\ntime series data with static content and network features to predict early meme\nvirality."}

This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful\nfeatures to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to\nboth reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via\nMatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of\nnumbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers.

Therefore, a natural idea is to endow\nreasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,\nrather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,\nwe propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of\nreasoning within a single response.

Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM.
