Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,\noutcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to\ncoincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental\nmismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a\ntheoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical\nselection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a\nseries of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a\nprincipled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into\nthe identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this\ntheory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's\niterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core\ndeficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy\nOptimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising\nprocess with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward\nfunction that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn\nstructured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this\nprincipled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning\nbenchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process."}

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and\nmonotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable\nacross various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled\nboth semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical\nminimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,\nthe model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic\ncontinuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory\naging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,\ntask-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in\nartificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von\nNeumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,\nand Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence."}

This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE).

To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

Previous methods either rely on text-level information\n(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,\nor on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on\nless-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial\nprojections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden\nstates. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical\nfeatures that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly\nalign with output logits, embedding confidence-related information.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,\nsensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the\nholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,\nwe introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the\nbridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the\nbridge architecture.

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and\nmonotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable\nacross various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction\nLearning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE\nformulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to\nprogressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates\nexecutable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the\nenvironment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.\nThrough this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model\nincrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via\nexploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only\nsubstantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,\nincreasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also\ndemonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an\naverage improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in\nboth perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for\nadvancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an\nefficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement\nlearning data.
