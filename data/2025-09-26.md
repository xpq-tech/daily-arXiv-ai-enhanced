### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖框架，通过修改外交事件叙述来将公众情绪从负面转向中性或正面，利用语言模型预测公众反应并生成反事实文本修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时费力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力，需要一种数据驱动的方法来优化外交事件叙述框架。

Method: 首先训练语言模型预测公众对外交事件的反应，构建包含事件描述和公众讨论的数据集；然后基于传播理论和专家意见确定可修改的文本特征；开发反事实生成算法系统性地产生文本修改版本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来优化外交事件叙述框架，培养更理想的公众情绪。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个说话者风格感知的音素锚定框架，用于跨语言语音情感识别，通过在说话者和音素空间进行双空间锚定来对齐不同语言间的情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临挑战，因为不同语言在语音变异性和说话者表达风格上存在差异，需要能够对齐不同说话者和语言间情感外化的框架。

Method: 通过基于图的聚类构建情感特定的说话者社区来捕捉共享的说话者特征，然后在说话者和音素空间应用双空间锚定，实现跨语言的情感传递。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，相比竞争基线方法具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了双空间锚定在跨语言语音情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

*Nithin Somasekharan,Ling Yue,Yadi Cao,Weichao Li,Patrick Emami,Pochinapeddi Sai Bhargav,Anurag Acharya,Xingyu Xie,Shaowu Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CFDLLMBench基准套件，用于评估大语言模型在计算流体动力学领域的科学能力，包括CFD知识、数值物理推理和工作流实现三个关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用NLP任务中表现出色，但在自动化复杂物理系统数值实验方面的应用仍未被充分探索。计算流体动力学作为计算科学的重要工具，为评估LLMs的科学能力提供了独特挑战。

Method: 开发了包含三个互补组件的CFDLLMBench基准套件：CFDQuery（研究生级CFD知识）、CFDCodeBench（CFD数值物理推理）和FoamBench（上下文相关的CFD工作流实现），基于真实CFD实践，结合详细任务分类和严格评估框架。

Result: 该基准能够提供可重现的结果，量化LLM在代码可执行性、解决方案准确性和数值收敛行为方面的性能表现。

Conclusion: CFDLLMBench为开发和评估LLM驱动的复杂物理系统数值实验自动化奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种机器学习方法检测ChatGPT-3.5生成文本的能力，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛使用，区分AI生成文本与人类写作变得至关重要，涉及学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等问题。

Method: 使用250对研究摘要数据集，测试了传统方法（逻辑回归+词袋、词性标注、TF-IDF）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT+N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT+自定义分类器、LSTM+N-gram），并尝试了集成学习。

Result: DistilBERT获得最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom表现稳定，LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法较差。集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，为未来开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

### [5] [ConceptViz: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Concepts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20376)
*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，旨在弥合稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征与人类可理解概念之间的差距，通过识别=>解释=>验证的流程帮助研究人员探索LLM中的概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SAE在从LLM中提取可解释特征方面表现出色，但这些特征并不天然与人类可理解的概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，允许用户使用感兴趣的概念查询SAE，交互式探索概念与特征的对应关系，并通过模型行为验证进行确认。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明，ConceptViz通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员构建更准确的LLM特征心智模型，系统代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at
https://github.com/Happy-Hippo209/ConceptViz.

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能并减少输入文档数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于检索系统可能返回不相关内容，将这些信息整合到模型中会导致幻觉问题。需要理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容来更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，设计基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上利用模型的自我知识来过滤无关检索内容

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中使用Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B进行评估，实验结果表明SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，为RAG系统的优化提供了有效方法

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，通过将帧级情感特征对齐到单词级别，实现基于LLM的TTS系统的词级情感控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感文本转语音系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法。

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征对齐到单词获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层映射并直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制。构建了FEDD数据集支持评估。

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM成功解决了现有E-TTS系统无法捕捉动态情感变化的问题，为细粒度情感控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了USB-Rec框架，通过集成训练-推理方法提升LLM在对话推荐系统中的性能，包括基于偏好的强化学习训练和自增强推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题，因此需要从模型层面提升LLM在对话推荐中的表现。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理策略，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20461)
*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Conformal Importance Summarization框架，使用保形预测为摘要生成提供严格的覆盖保证，确保关键内容在摘要中得到保留


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动摘要系统在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域缺乏对关键内容包含的可靠保证

Method: 通过校准句子级重要性分数的阈值，实现具有用户指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，方法模型无关且只需小规模校准集

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization达到了理论保证的信息覆盖率

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: ShortCheck是一个用于检测短视频平台（如TikTok）中值得核查内容的模块化系统，通过多模态分析帮助人工事实核查员识别虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台的多模态、动态和嘈杂内容给虚假信息检测带来了独特挑战，需要专门工具来辅助人工事实核查。

Method: 采用模块化、仅推理的流水线，集成语音转录、OCR、物体和深度伪造检测、视频到文本摘要以及声明验证等技术。

Result: 在两个手动标注的多语言TikTok视频数据集上验证，系统F1加权分数超过70%，表现出有前景的性能。

Conclusion: ShortCheck为短视频平台的虚假信息检测提供了有效的自动化解决方案，能够显著提升事实核查效率。

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object
and deepfake detection, video-to-text summarization, and claim verification.
ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets
with TikTok videos in a multilingual setting. The pipeline achieves promising
results with F1-weighted score over 70\%.

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟论文评审流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与MAD相同准确率的同时将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论(MAD)方法虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但由于需要多个智能体频繁交互，带来了巨大的计算开销。

Method: MARS采用类似论文评审的流程：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，评审者智能体独立提供决策和评论，元评审者整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订，避免了评审者之间的直接交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与MAD的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS框架在保持推理质量的同时有效控制了计算成本，为大语言模型的高效协作推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了SiniticMTError数据集，这是一个为英语到普通话、粤语和吴语的机器翻译提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注的新数据集，旨在支持低资源语言的机器翻译研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得了重大进展，但对于许多缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源的低资源语言（如粤语和吴语），进展仍然有限。这些语言虽然各有超过8000万使用者，但资源匮乏限制了其机器翻译的发展。

Method: 基于现有的平行语料库构建SiniticMTError数据集，通过母语者的严格标注流程，提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性注释，并分析标注者间一致性、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重性的模式。

Result: 创建了一个包含英语到普通话、粤语和吴语机器翻译错误标注的数据集，支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估等研究。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集为机器翻译社区提供了一个资源，可用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型，促进低资源语言机器翻译的研究和发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一的多语言医疗诊断框架，能够在英语、印地语和孟加拉语之间进行零样本跨语言疾病诊断，无需语言特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗环境中，由于低资源语言缺乏标注医疗数据和不同人群的语言变异性，自动疾病诊断仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制和疾病分类头，使用孪生对比学习模块实现跨语言语义对齐，采用多任务学习策略联合优化分类、翻译对齐和对比学习目标，并应用MAML实现快速适应能力。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%的测试准确率和97.17%的F1分数；在零样本场景下，印地语达到92.78%准确率，孟加拉语达到73.33%准确率。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力，特别是在低资源语言环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态推理链架构，通过深度专业化的专家混合模型，根据输入复杂度动态组装定制推理链，实现计算效率提升和推理质量改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入应用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询和复杂逻辑问题都经过多层计算，造成资源浪费并限制深度推理能力

Method: 提出深度专业化专家混合模型（DS-MoE），包含针对不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理、记忆整合、元认知监督），通过学习路由网络动态组装推理链

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示，DS-MoE相比均匀深度Transformer实现16%计算节省、35%推理速度提升，在复杂多步推理基准上准确率提高2.8%

Conclusion: DS-MoE是自适应神经架构的重要进展，证明深度专业化模块化处理能同时提升大规模语言模型的效率、推理质量和可解释性

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT是一种受小波启发的分层分辨率Transformer架构，通过多分辨率注意力机制处理语言，实现了O(nlogn)复杂度，在多个基准测试中优于标准Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构将文本处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次结构，导致二次计算复杂度、弱组合泛化能力和不足的语篇级建模。

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer(HRT)，构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的语境化，采用跨尺度的指数序列缩减。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中，HRT平均优于标准Transformer基线3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明多尺度小波启发的处理既能获得理论效率增益，又能实际提升语言理解能力。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练，在保持质量的同时实现快速语言生成，8步采样即可达到1024步基线的性能，提速128倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要大量迭代步骤，两者在速度和质量之间存在权衡。需要一种既能并行生成又能减少采样步数的方法。

Method: 提出FS-DFM模型，核心思想是将采样步数作为训练参数，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性；采用可靠的更新规则避免过冲；使用长轨迹蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步骤就达到了1024步离散流基线的困惑度性能，生成1024个token时采样速度提升128倍，相应降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量。

Conclusion: FS-DFM通过少步采样实现了高质量语言生成，在保持性能的同时显著提升了生成效率，为快速语言生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型性能预测问题，提出了PRECOG语料库，通过检索模块实现仅基于任务描述和配置来预测模型性能，无需实际运行实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型评估瓶颈，探索在运行实验前预测模型性能的可能性，以支持更智能的实验优先级排序。

Method: 构建PRECOG语料库，使用检索模块从已发表论文中获取相关信息，基于任务描述和配置预测模型性能得分。

Result: 该方法在准确性子集上达到8.7的平均绝对误差，GPT-5在零泄漏设置下仍能获得显著预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，需要解决数据稀疏问题来构建高质量的口语评估语音识别器。

Method: 1）多任务训练方案，引入辅助损失函数估计正交文本标签和输入信号的音高模式；2）融合基于音素字母串和文本标记序列的两个估计器，使用有限状态转换器框架算法进行组合。

Result: 提出的方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音素标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和模型融合对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，所提方法显著提升了日语口语评估任务的识别性能。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测（MPP）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN和自监督学习在MPP方面取得进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs存在知识空白和幻觉问题，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码进行分子向量化，产生基于知识的特征，然后与结构表示融合。使用了GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLM进行知识提取。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与结构特征的集成是提升分子性质预测性能的有效途径，特别是在处理研究不足的分子性质时。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管攻击检测模型已被证明能成功识别对抗性文本攻击，但其可靠性尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在测试检测模型在面对专门针对其设计的攻击时的可靠性。

Method: 提出RedHerring攻击方法，通过修改文本使检测模型预测为攻击，但保持分类器的正确预测。在4个数据集上对3种检测器和4种分类器进行了测试。

Result: RedHerring能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出的简单置信度检查防御方法无需重新训练即可大幅提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型为攻击者如何针对检测模型提供了新的见解，揭示了检测模型在面对专门攻击时的脆弱性。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合广义BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗性文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect技术与GreedySelect合并；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于哪些长度的文本来结合广义Binary和GreedySelect。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均可将每次攻击所需的查询次数减少25.82%，且不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了对抗性文本攻击中高计算成本的问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的攻击测试方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，用于在域不匹配情况下进行语音情感识别，通过结合大型音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，使学生模型在目标域超越LALM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的语音情感识别在域不匹配情况下经常失败，源数据不可用且强大的LALM只能通过API访问，需要开发能够在仅使用未标记目标域音频和API-only LALM的情况下使学生模型适应目标域的方法

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架，使用源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，从两个教师模型获取随机预测，基于互信息的不确定性加权其平均分布，并使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移实验上显示一致增益，学生模型超越LALM并在最强基线基础上提升3.9%

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实可行的适应

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在复杂推理任务中置信度评估不够可靠，需要一种能够无缝集成到各种模型中的通用框架来提升答案的可靠性。

Method: C2R首先构建子问题及其答案的子集来探索不同推理路径，然后比较候选答案的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。该方法完全基于模型自身的置信度评分，无需额外训练。

Result: C2R在多种模型和基准测试中表现出一致的性能提升，能够无缝集成到现有的问答模型中。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题的数量和质量对模型推理鲁棒性和可靠性的影响，为理解模型行为提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了监督微调(SFT)对LLM通用能力的负面影响，发现使用较小学习率可以显著缓解性能下降，并提出了Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR)方法来更好地平衡领域特定性能与通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者发现这种权衡可以通过适当的方法来缓解，需要系统性地研究如何平衡领域适应与通用能力保持。

Method: 首先通过实验验证小学习率的效果，然后提出TALR方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等方法进行对比评估。

Result: 实验表明TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面优于其他基线方法，虽然无法完全消除权衡，但能实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出了实用指导原则：使用小学习率获得有利权衡；当需要更强平衡时，采用TALR作为有效策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的内部表示基本单元（神经元或特征）存在多义性、重构不可靠和不稳定性问题，需要定义更可靠的基本单元来理解模型机制。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本单元，引入原子内积修正表示偏移，证明原子满足RIP条件，训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上进行验证。

Result: 在多个模型上实现了99.9%的稀疏重构，99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件（相比神经元的0.5%和特征的68.2%），表明原子能更准确地捕捉LLMs的内在表示。

Conclusion: 原子理论为大语言模型的内部表示理解提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的对话式提示方法，将用户评论重新表述为多轮对话，用于少样本、免训练的个性化评论生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和免训练的情况，传统方法假设目标用户有大量评论历史或需要额外模型训练，而LLMs的有效性依赖于提示工程。

Method: 提出了对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并要求模型纠正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使每个用户只有2条评论。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和免训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中表现出强大的推理能力，但在知识密集型场景（如知识图谱问答）中仍存在幻觉和事实错误问题。这主要是由于结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟造成的。

Method: 提出Enrich-on-Graph（EoG）框架，利用LLM的先验知识对知识图谱进行丰富，通过三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐度，并提供了优化目标的理论验证。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，EoG能够有效生成高质量知识图谱，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架能够有效弥合知识图谱与查询之间的语义鸿沟，实现高效、精确的推理，同时保证低计算成本、可扩展性和跨方法的适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

### [29] [Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error Overcorrection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20811)
*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO方法通过先利用大语言模型进行过度修正以提高召回率，然后使用小模型进行后修正来平衡精度，从而提升语法错误校正的整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在监督微调后可靠性高但修正不足（高精度低召回），而大语言模型倾向于过度修正（低精度高召回）。需要结合两者的优势来平衡语法错误校正的性能。

Method: PoCO方法分两步：1）利用LLM进行故意过度修正以最大化召回率；2）使用微调的小模型进行针对性后修正，识别和优化错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO能有效平衡GEC性能，在保持竞争力的精度同时提高召回率，提升语法错误校正的整体质量。

Conclusion: PoCO通过结合LLMs的生成能力和小监督模型的可靠性，成功解决了语法错误校正中召回率和精度的平衡问题。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为cheat-sheet ICL的新方法，通过将多示例上下文学习的信息提炼为简洁的文本摘要，在推理时使用更少的token实现与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的多示例上下文学习虽然有效但计算成本高，需要处理大量输入token。需要一种更高效的方法来利用LLMs进行下游任务。

Method: 开发了cheat-sheet ICL方法，将多示例上下文学习的信息蒸馏为简洁的文本摘要（作弊表），在推理时仅使用这个摘要作为上下文。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token实现了与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，并且无需测试时检索就能匹敌基于检索的ICL方法。

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLMs进行下游任务的一个实用替代方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低计算需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于树搜索的零样本句子重写算法，用于保护大语言模型使用中的隐私信息，在保持文本自然性和实用性的同时有效隐藏敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息。现有的文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性。

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型，动态探索重写空间，逐步改写隐私敏感片段。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持文本质量的同时有效保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的引用通常在句子或段落级别，存在引用内容过长包含无关信息，或者引用不足需要用户阅读上下文的问题，影响验证效率。

Result: 在构建的数据集上实验表明，该方法能生成高质量、更易读的引用。

Conclusion: 提出的子句级引用方法能有效减少用户验证生成内容正确性的工作量，提升RAG系统的可验证性。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

TL;DR: WeFT是一种基于熵加权的监督微调方法，用于解决扩散语言模型在生成过程中缺乏精确概率估计的问题，通过在推理基准测试上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏每个去噪步骤的精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致，需要控制关键标记来引导生成方向。

Method: 提出WeFT方法，基于扩散理论为标记分配不同的权重，权重根据标记的熵值确定，实现对扩散语言模型的加权监督微调。

Result: 在open-r1数据集的s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，WeFT在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准测试上相比标准SFT分别实现了39%、64%和83%的相对改进。

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型监督微调的挑战，显著提升了推理任务的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医疗推理模型主要训练生成单一答案，需要开发支持排名列表答案格式的方法。

Method: 采用提示和微调两种方法，包括监督微调和强化微调，并提出针对排名列表格式的新奖励函数。

Result: 监督微调模型在某些答案格式上表现良好，但强化微调模型在多种格式下更具稳健性。模型能够识别有效答案，即使不是基准的首选答案。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统研究医疗推理模型生成排名列表答案的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代答案格式迈出了第一步。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在长文档摘要任务中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提升摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含摘要生成器、摘要评审器、问题生成器、问题评审器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种利用对抗性智能体协作来提升长文档摘要质量的新方法，证明了多智能体协作动态的有效性。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于词汇重叠和困惑度的记忆化检测方法泛化能力差，对隐式污染数据效果不佳，需要更有效的检测手段。

Method: MemLens方法分析数值标记在生成过程中的概率轨迹，通过观察模型层间概率变化模式来区分记忆化样本和正常推理样本。

Result: 实验发现受污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，通过LoRA微调注入的样本也表现出与自然污染数据相同的轨迹模式。

Conclusion: MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关，为LLM记忆化检测提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [37] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

<details>

Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言（如阿拉伯语）的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发多语言工具增强代理。

Method: 通过将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语，在阿拉伯语LLM的基座和训练后变体上进行广泛实验。

Result: 研究结果揭示了开发阿拉伯语工具增强代理的最佳策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为阿拉伯语工具调用能力的发展提供了重要见解，有助于缩小多语言工具调用研究的差距。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在教育领域作为自动评估工具的潜力，特别是在学术文本输入问题的评分方面，以减轻教师负担并提供一致性评估。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估，使用三个LLM模型（JudgeLM、Llama-3.1-8B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B）在110个计算机科学学生答案数据集上进行测试。

Result: 参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214），能提供公平评分和全面评估。其他方法在简洁答案评估或信息完整性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 基于人工智能的自动评估系统在适当方法论的辅助下，有潜力作为其他学术资源的补充工具，特别是在文本输入问题的评估方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索因果掩码作为位置信息来源的作用，分析其与显式位置编码（如RoPE）的相互作用。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，证明因果掩码能诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并分析其与RoPE的交互效应。

Result: 因果掩码会诱导偏向邻近查询-键对的注意力模式，与RoPE相互作用会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力模式为非相对模式。

Conclusion: 因果掩码应被视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源，在现代大语言模型中这一效应普遍存在。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实场景中的应用增加，理解它们同时遵循多条指令的能力变得至关重要，但评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行。

Method: 创建ManyIFEval（最多10条指令的文本生成）和StyleMBPP（最多6条指令的代码生成）两个基准，使用逻辑回归模型基于指令数量预测性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，LLMs性能持续下降；逻辑回归模型能以约10%误差预测未见指令组合的性能，仅需500（ManyIFEval）和300（StyleMBPP）个样本即可有效评估。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了LLMs在多指令跟随方面的局限性，并提供了高效评估方法，为实际应用中的性能预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多个领域表现出色，但在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未充分探索。本文旨在评估基础模型在材料强度这一重要工程领域的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出Descriptions of Images (DoI)提示策略，提供专家生成的图像文本描述作为上下文。评估了8个代表性基础模型（包括LLMs和VLMs），使用包含文本问题陈述和示意图的SoM-1K数据集进行测试。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率仅56.6%。有趣的是，配备DoI的LLMs通常优于直接处理视觉图的VLMs。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 本研究为工程AI建立了严谨的基准，强调了开发更强大多模态推理能力的迫切需求，特别是在科学和工程背景下。准确的文本描述在当前阶段比直接图像输入更有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [44] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文识别并系统研究了LLMs中的文化定位偏见，即模型默认生成立场与主流美国文化对齐，将其他文化视为局外人。提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，证明基于智能体的方法能有效减轻偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在生成内容时存在文化偏见，倾向于从主流美国文化视角出发，对非主流文化表现出外部性，这可能导致公平性问题。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。设计了两种缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于智能体的MFA框架（包括单智能体MFA-SA和多智能体MFA-MA）。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的评估显示，模型在美国情境脚本中平均88%以上采用内部视角，但对弱势文化主要采用外部立场。基于智能体的方法被证明是缓解偏见的有前景方向。

Conclusion: LLMs存在显著的文化定位偏见，需要系统性干预。基于智能体的框架为减轻生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外在和内在幻觉，评估了12个LLM在波斯语文本上的幻觉检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低资源语言（如波斯语）中普遍存在的幻觉问题，特别是针对波斯文化特定内容的评估需求。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程，结合人工验证生成可信的问答和摘要任务答案，利用生成标记的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并引入人工标注来突出波斯文化特定语境。

Result: 评估的12个LLM在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍表现不佳，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可以部分缓解幻觉问题，专门为波斯语训练的LLM与其他模型在幻觉方面没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语LLM在幻觉检测方面存在显著挑战，需要专门针对低资源语言的评估基准和改进方法，外部知识注入是缓解幻觉的有效策略之一。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强大语言模型个性化能力的基准测试，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史来构建，旨在系统评估个性化信息检索系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然减轻了用户的认知负担，但在满足不同用户的个性化需求方面仍显不足，缺乏对个性化效果的系统性评估方法。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注，收集真实的用户聊天和搜索历史，构建包含详细信息需求的查询，并提供细粒度的偏好评分和反馈。

Result: BESPOKE基准测试揭示了信息检索任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLMs的细粒度评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE为评估个性化搜索增强LLMs提供了一个现实且诊断性的基准，填补了该领域系统性评估的空白。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个语音版本的BBQ数据集，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见，通过将文本语境转换为受控语音条件来测量模型的偏见表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容和声学两个不同来源，需要专门的评估方法来同时诊断这两种偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的每个语境转换为受控语音条件，通过测量模型在模糊和明确语境下的回答来计算准确率、偏见和一致性分数。

Result: 评估了两个语音语言模型：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，可以联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见，有助于模型偏见评估和改进。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [48] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含9,208个语音样本的新数据集，用于系统分析语音语言模型中的声学性别偏见现象。研究发现LLaMA-Omni系列模型存在矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题中表现出男性导向的偏见，而在需要性别区分的语境适当问题中却表现出性别无关的回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型虽然实现了基于语音的人机交互，但可能存在基于声学的性别偏见问题，即相同问题因说话者性别不同而得到不同回应。需要系统分析这种现象。

Method: 构建包含性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类问题的数据集，评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析中性选项和语音性别感知的影响，比较语音模型与对应骨干语言模型。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题中所有模型都表现出男性导向回应；在性别依赖问题中模型反而表现出性别无关回应。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器产生的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型虽然优先考虑一般公平原则，但未能成功消除性别偏见，且牺牲了语境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来正确处理语音技术中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ROC的新框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，以克服传统分类方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：忽视实体类型和位置线索等结构约束，以及缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似度的对比学习来对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并展现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索而非分类的方式，有效解决了多模态关系抽取中的结构约束和语义表达问题，为关系理解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现LLM在训练过程中会形成句法结构与任务领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性有时会覆盖提示语义，影响模型性能，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM如何同时处理指令的语义、领域和句法信息，特别是当句法结构与特定领域形成虚假相关性时对模型行为的影响。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析句法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型的影响，建立评估框架检测真实数据集中的这种现象，并进行安全微调案例研究。

Result: 发现句法-领域相关性会降低模型在实体知识任务上的性能（均值0.51±0.06），在OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick和GPT-4o等模型中均存在此现象，且可用于绕过拒绝响应机制。

Conclusion: 需要显式测试句法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中特别是领域内的句法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且常依赖语境的概念，需要广泛推理能力来理解和创造，因此是评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 本文采用文献综述的方法，调查计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但在双关语之外的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型仍无法达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 作者强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并基于幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性，提出了该领域未来研究的广泛讨论方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于小型语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题，提出了专门针对PII提取的GEP方法，相比传统模板方法泄露量增加60倍，在自由格式插入场景下仍能达到4.53%的泄露率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLM）在某些领域表现出与大型语言模型相当的性能，且训练和推理能耗更低，但其在下游任务中的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出GEP方法——一种基于贪婪坐标梯度的PII提取技术，专门针对SLM条件设计，并在自由格式插入等复杂场景下进行测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，GEP方法相比传统模板方法PII泄露量增加了60倍，在自由格式插入的复杂场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: 基于SLM的聊天机器人存在显著的PII泄露风险，传统模板攻击方法在SLM条件下效果有限，而专门设计的GEP方法能有效提取PII信息，揭示了SLM在隐私保护方面的安全隐患。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索导致推理碎片化（工具税），以及多智能体管道稀释强解决方案。

Method: 基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）进行结构化协作。

Result: 在HLE Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率（当前最高），比最强基线提升13.4点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示推理失败和知识差距在85%以上案例中共现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CLaw基准，专门用于评估LLMs在中国法律知识及其推理应用方面的能力，包含法规语料库和案例推理实例，发现现有模型在法律条款准确引用方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在法律文本分析中可靠性不足，因为通用预训练缺乏对法律文本的专业关注，需要专门基准来评估其法律知识和推理能力。

Method: 构建CLaw基准，包含：(1) 306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库（64,849条目），(2) 254个基于最高法院案例的推理实例，用于评估法律知识应用。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLMs难以准确复述法律条款，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确知识检索（通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大推理能力的协同，本工作为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem（句子图记忆）是一种用于长期对话代理的记忆管理方法，通过句子级图结构组织对话历史，结合原始对话和生成记忆来提升LLM的上下文理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法在组织不同粒度对话信息和检索相关信息方面存在困难，需要更有效的记忆管理来处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长对话历史。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索的原始对话与生成的记忆（摘要、事实和见解）。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高了准确性，并在长期对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子级图结构有效组织对话记忆，为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文，显著提升了长期对话代理的性能。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCG-RAG是一个查询中心的图RAG框架，通过查询粒度索引和多跳块检索来解决现有图RAG方法在粒度选择上的困境，在问答准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图会产生高令牌成本并丢失上下文，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建具有可控粒度的查询中心图，采用定制化的多跳检索机制通过生成的查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散模型中的同音异义词重复问题，提出了一种测量重复率的方法，并通过自动和人工评估验证了提示扩展方法能有效缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词在提示中出现时，扩散模型可能同时生成该词的多个含义，导致同音异义重复问题。此外，Anglocentric偏见使得非英语中的非同音词在翻译成英语后也可能变成同音词而失去原意。

Method: 引入了一种测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型进行自动评估和人工评估，并研究了通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义重复问题的方法。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型的表现，证明提示扩展方法能有效减少同音异义重复问题，包括由Anglocentric偏见引起的重复。

Conclusion: 提出的自动评估管道代码已公开，提示扩展是缓解扩散模型中同音异义重复问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出任务依赖的输出同质化评估和缓解方法，通过任务分类、功能多样性定义和任务锚定采样技术，在保持质量的同时提高任务相关的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作未能以任务依赖的方式概念化输出同质化问题，不同任务对同质化的定义和可接受程度不同。

Method: 提出包含八个任务类别的分类法，定义任务锚定功能多样性，开发任务锚定采样技术，挑战多样性-质量权衡的认知。

Result: 成功提高了功能多样性同时保持响应质量，证明了任务依赖方法在评估和缓解输出同质化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 任务依赖的方法显著改进了输出同质化的评估和缓解策略，为不同任务类型提供了更精准的多样性控制。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

TL;DR: LLMTrace是一个新的大规模双语语料库，用于AI生成文本检测，支持全文二分类和AI生成区间检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要为英语、缺乏混合人机作者场景，且没有提供字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段。

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语语料库，提供字符级标注，支持全文二分类和AI生成区间检测。

Result: 开发了LLMTrace数据集，包含英语和俄语文本，具有字符级标注，可用于训练更精细实用的AI检测模型。

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种结合了冻结CLIP视觉Transformer和新型张量网络文本编码器的多模态编码器，通过显式编码句法结构来改进视觉语言模型的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略了语言的结构性，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解保持模型高效性，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: DisCoCLIP显著提高了对动词语义和词序的敏感性：将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升到82.4%，ARO归因和关系得分分别提高9%和4%以上，在SVO-Swap基准测试中达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对思维链（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明该上界与推理步数正相关，且无限长的推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明CoT输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏对扰动如何影响推理过程的理论解释，这限制了我们对扰动传播机制的理解和提示优化方法的改进。

Method: 首先理论推导输入扰动上界，分析其与推理步数的关系；然后将结论应用于线性自注意力模型，分析扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量范数的关系；最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：1）输入扰动上界与推理步数正相关；2）无限长推理无法消除输入扰动影响；3）在线性自注意力模型中，扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量范数负相关。实验结果与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: 本文首次从理论角度解释了输入扰动对CoT输出的影响机制，为理解扰动传播和优化提示方法提供了理论依据，实验验证了理论分析的正确性。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

TL;DR: RLBFF结合了RLHF的人类偏好灵活性和RLVR的规则验证精确性，通过将自然语言反馈转化为可二进制回答的原则来训练奖励模型，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF缺乏可解释性和奖励攻击问题，以及RLVR局限于正确性验证的限制，希望结合人类偏好的灵活性和规则验证的精确性。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二进制回答的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应是否满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上达到81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排行榜第一），使用RLBFF对齐的Qwen3-32B在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种可解释且灵活的奖励建模方法，允许用户在推理时指定关注原则，并以开源方式实现了高性能的对齐方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

TL;DR: 本文提出了Updesh数据集，这是一个针对13种印度语言的大规模合成指令跟随数据集，通过基于维基百科内容的语言特定数据生成策略，旨在解决多语言AI系统在低资源环境下的文化适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在多语言环境下有效运作且保持文化适应性的AI系统是一个长期挑战，特别是在低资源环境中。合成数据提供了一个有前景的途径，但其在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成数据，补充了从高资源语言（如英语）翻译合成数据集的主流自上而下范式。

Result: 生成的Updesh数据集包含950万个数据点，涵盖13种印度语言，包含多样化的推理和生成任务。评估显示生成数据质量高，在低资源和中资源语言中相对改进最为显著，缩小了与高资源语言的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化基础的方法进行多方面的数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型中的奉承行为可分为奉承性同意和奉承性赞美，这两种行为与真诚同意在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立调控而不相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出奉承行为，但尚不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，在多个模型和数据集上对比奉承性同意、奉承性赞美和真诚同意三种行为。

Result: 三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，每种行为可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为，且这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 奉承行为对应着不同的、可独立操控的表示，表明它们是独立的过程而非单一机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的代理系统中的错误，重点关注代理工具调用和状态转换的行为序列而非具体文本输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性而显得脆弱，需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，通过监控代理工具调用和执行轨迹的时间序列，使用时间表达式语言来捕获正确的行为模式，验证提示工程和防护措施的有效性。

Result: 在三代理系统的实验中，使用大型模型时所有时间断言都得到满足，但当两个代理使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中部署的代理系统，能够有效检测生产环境中的行为退化。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤采用统一计算量，不考虑实例复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS方法在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受标准来决定是否重采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念动态调整计算量。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算效率权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配策略，有效解决了测试时计算效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a

insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统（TTS）的调度方案，解决消息碰撞、优先级处理不当导致的锁定循环等问题，确保系统安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间触发系统在动态操作环境中面临消息碰撞、优先级处理不当导致的锁定循环、生成不完整或无效调度等挑战，这些都会影响系统安全性和性能。

Method: 提出重构框架，通过系统地将AI生成或启发式得出的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度，确保遵守关键系统约束（如优先级规则和无碰撞通信），包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制。

Result: 在多性能配置文件（包括最小化完成时间、工作负载平衡和能效）上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键TTS中的安全调度生成问题提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，即使在高度动态和不确定的操作条件下也能实现可靠和灵活实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成在元调度器中的自适应在线学习单元，通过强化学习实时优化调度决策，解决传统离线训练方法在多调度图构建中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练AI调度推理时，构建全面的多调度图(MSG)面临资源密集和不可行的问题，特别是在考虑硬件故障、松弛变化等复杂上下文事件时。

Method: 在元调度器中集成在线学习单元，使用强化学习模型实时探索和发现新的调度解决方案，动态扩展多调度图并优化现有调度器。

Conclusion: 该方法使系统在大规模安全关键环境中保持灵活性和鲁棒性，通过动态适应确保任务执行的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于肌电信号控制手部假体的新型识别系统，通过检测受污染的生物信号来减轻污染的不利影响。该系统包含两个集成：一组用于评估单个通道污染程度的一类分类器，以及一个用于识别患者意图的K近邻分类器集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假体通常使用肌电生物信号进行模式识别控制，但由于人类来源和假体接口的多种因素，难以获得可接受的分类质量。生物信号对污染的高度敏感性会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 开发了一个原始、一致的模糊模型，允许在整个识别过程中使用统一的软（模糊）决策方案。系统由两个集成组成：一类分类器用于检测污染，K近邻分类器用于意图识别。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析，并与文献中描述的系统进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测和减轻生物信号污染对假体控制质量的不利影响。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在生成有意义的反思方面存在挑战，主要由于错误分析不足和依赖罕见成功轨迹，特别是在复杂任务中

Method: SAMULE框架包含三个互补层次的反思合成：单轨迹学习（微观）、任务内学习（中观）和任务间学习（宏观），然后微调语言模型作为回顾性模型，并扩展到交互式设置

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自我改进的LLM代理中起着关键作用

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day

cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Conclusion: 证明了结合结构化群体评分与模块化工具增强推理的可行性，系统具有可追溯性、最小化幻觉和跨协议鲁棒性

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多代理移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有移动GUI代理在真实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理应用中面临两个主要问题：端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，以及缺乏用户交互的代理会单方面行动损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(i)全局任务规划器从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(ii)应用级执行器基于长短时记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心代理在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(iii)自学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Conclusion: Fairy通过其交互和自学习能力，在真实移动场景中表现出显著优势，证明了其在处理多样化应用界面和不断变化的用户需求方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its

Motivation: AR模型虽然能生成连贯输出但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；NAR模型虽然能并行生成实现加速，但输出质量通常较差。需要结合两者优势来解决这些局限性。

Method: 采用AR和NAR模型集成框架：NAR模型负责高效生成中间推理轨迹，AR模型基于这些轨迹生成精确的最终答案。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线实现了26%的显著改进，同时大幅降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 提出的AR-NAR集成框架在推理任务中取得了性能提升和效率优化的双重优势，为解决复杂推理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto通过反事实推理框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，为模型真正理解图像内容提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: GALAX是一个创新框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，实现可解释的疾病相关子图生成，用于精准医学中的靶点和通路发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中只能部分利用多组学特征、拓扑结构和文本知识，限制了机制可解释性。需要整合定量多组学信号、拓扑结构和文献级文本，通过子图推理作为桥梁。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以强化学习方式逐步生成疾病相关子图。同时引入Target-QA基准数据集支持GNN预训练和长上下文推理。

Result: 该框架实现了过程级监督而无需显式中间推理标注，支持在文本-数值图上进行长上下文推理，为精准医学提供可扩展且生物学基础的解释性子图推理。

Conclusion: GALAX为精准医学中的可靠和可解释的靶点和通路发现提供了一个可扩展的、基于生物学基础的强化学习指导子图推理框架。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，旨在解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论中细微反馈的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论文本中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征方面存在困难。

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取详细的特征级洞察，并通过检索增强的对话问答支持评论的交互式探索。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（AWARE、Google Play和Spotify）上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著超越基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性洞察。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析方法的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将大语言模型生成的化学合成路径与系统性的AND-OR树搜索相结合的逆合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步逆合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的计算挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制

Method: 通过原子级映射生成的完整合成路径到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数达到竞争性的解决率

Conclusion: AOT*框架有效解决了逆合成规划中的效率问题，特别是在复杂分子目标上表现出更显著的优势

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理评估基准通常将评估简化为最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE评估套件包含路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，提供比传统方法更全面和细致的性能分析。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题测试模型的信息聚合和合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、专注于简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，SciTrek旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，支持高达100万token的上下文。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习带来的改进有限，模型在基本数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的关键局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过三个智能体协同工作，在知识图谱上进行多跳问答的上下文构建，在保证准确率的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在保持准确性的同时满足延迟和成本约束。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG实现了+39.3 EM@1，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注组合泛化能力，但无法有效评估大型语言模型在科学创意生成等开放性创造性任务中的表现，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出了基于新颖性和实用性的理论框架和算法任务，通过系统实验研究不同模型规模（深度和宽度）对创造力的影响，并分析创意-执行差距现象。

Result: 发现创造力随模型规模呈现复杂变化规律；在固定计算预算下存在最优模型深度和宽度；揭示了新颖性与实用性之间的根本性权衡关系。

Conclusion: 当前形式的大型语言模型在长期创造性潜力上存在局限性，新颖性-实用性权衡即使在模型规模扩大后仍然存在，为理解和改进AI创造力提供了新基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著提高了对未见网站的适应性和长时程任务的解决能力。

Conclusion: Recon-Act框架通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，有效解决了多模态智能体在复杂网页任务中的执行问题，为智能浏览器使用代理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括分数比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器存在严重的不一致性问题：分数比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出了TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM-as-a-judge评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: 当前方法通常不加区分地使用思维链数据，但哪些数据类型能最有效提升模型推理能力仍是一个关键问题。本文旨在识别和利用高价值推理模式来增强模型的推理潜力。

Method: 1. 定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数；2. 从思维链序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式；3. 构建富含价值推理模式的核心参考集；4. 提出基于推理模式链和令牌熵的双粒度算法，从数据池中选择高价值思维链数据。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以显著提升大模型的数学推理能力，同时大幅减少所需训练数据量，为高效训练推理模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析框架，用于量化大语言模型在强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)训练过程中的推理路径变化，揭示了两种方法在塑造推理能力方面的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RL和SFT被广泛用于提升LLMs的推理能力，但这些方法如何具体塑造推理过程仍不清楚。本文旨在超越基于准确性的分析，从推理路径的角度深入理解训练过程的影响。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级（完整推理输出）和步骤级（推理图节点）两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径的变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使推理图节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，而SFT将其减少到约三分之一，表明RL将推理功能集中在少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布在多个步骤。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练最佳实践之所以成功，是因为两种方法在塑造推理过程上具有互补性，这为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑他人策略。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法，包括：1）基于推理他人策略生成推演；2）在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法能有效增强模型在战略决策中的能力，特别是在感知他人策略和游戏趋势方面表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的协同效应，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和执行任务的统一建模。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLMs通过分布式专业化机制而非模块化架构来处理稀有词汇，揭示了三种组织原则：三区影响层次、协调激活模式和通用注意力通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何处理稀有词汇，探索其内部是采用离散模块化架构还是分布式参数级分化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究稀有词汇处理中的神经元激活模式和权重相关性。

Result: 发现稀有词汇处理通过分布式专业化实现，存在可复现的三区影响层次，且专业化机制通过标准注意力通路即可访问。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非混合专家式模块化来处理稀有词汇，这对模型编辑和效率优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLMs在单次推理范式下处理多跳问答任务时的容量限制问题，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了一个多调用框架InfoQA来解决容量溢出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs具有有限的单次输出容量，超过这个容量后任务相关证据的整合变得不可靠，导致单次推理范式存在固有脆弱性。

Method: 建立Fano-style精度上界理论框架，提出InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前推理轨迹来保持信息负载在单次限制内，采用依赖显式的工作流实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。构建了一个严格且噪声丰富的基准来验证理论和框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了任务复杂度超过模型容量时精度必然崩溃的规律，为容量感知的表示和结构化提供了通用原则。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个研究大型语言模型（LLM）智能体在无外部任务约束下行为的架构，通过持续推理和行动框架发现智能体会自发形成三种行为模式，这些模式具有模型特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在无外部任务约束下的自主行为，为预测任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主操作时的行为建立基线。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发组织成三种行为模式：多周期项目生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、以及自身本质的递归概念化。这些行为具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统记录无提示LLM智能体行为的研究，为预测部署系统中智能体在任务模糊或长期自主操作时的行为提供了基准。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反射认知架构（RCA）的新框架，旨在解决医疗疾病预测中准确性与可解释性之间的平衡问题。RCA通过协调多个大语言模型，利用预测误差迭代优化规则，并基于数据集全局统计进行推理，实现了高准确性和高质量解释的双重目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法在疾病预测中难以同时实现高准确性和透明解释。许多模型要么准确但解释不清晰，要么生成流畅但缺乏统计支持的叙述。这种浅层数据交互阻碍了模型发展出类似人类专家的深度理解能力。

Method: 提出反射认知架构（RCA），协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习。采用迭代规则优化机制从预测错误中改进逻辑，以及分布感知规则检查机制基于数据集全局统计进行推理。通过预测准确性作为信号驱动深度理解，构建强大的数据内部模型。

Result: 在一个私有和两个公共数据集上评估RCA，与22个基线模型比较。结果显示RCA不仅实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性（相对改进高达40%），更重要的是能够生成清晰、逻辑性强、基于证据且平衡的解释。

Conclusion: RCA通过深度理解数据，成功实现了高准确性和高质量解释的协同提升，展示了创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力。高准确性和高质量解释不是分离的目标，而是模型深度理解数据的相互强化结果。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Motivation: 面对扩展定律，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集符合特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，定义用户友好的需求指定方式，并提出两种可随用户交互更新的过滤策略。

Conclusion: 广泛实验证明了VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）在30+数据集上全面评估嵌入模型和相似度指标，揭示了现有方法的性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现强劲，需要更挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解能力。现有基准关注孤立能力，而SAGE旨在通过对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务进行更全面的评估。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估维度，在30多个数据集上测试了9种嵌入模型和经典相似度指标。评估涵盖对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务。

Result: 评估显示没有单一方法在所有维度上表现优异：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性上被Jaccard相似度（0.905）显著超越；text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限，为实际部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估，表明需要针对不同应用场景选择合适的模型和指标。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
