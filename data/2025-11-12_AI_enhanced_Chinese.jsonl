The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks.

Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba9LLMs\u5185\u5316\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u56fe\u5373\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cftoken\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9LLMs\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba9LLMs\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u56fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIP\u6210\u529f\u8ba9LLMs\u5185\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684token\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc77\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u8fa9\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u7ea7LLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b4\u9636\u6bb5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u75285\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u6311\u6218\u3001\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89e3\u6563\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u8ffd\u6c42\u6839\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9884\u9632\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing.

We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement.

On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information.

We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy.

We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4(OPORDs)\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u524dLLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u590d\u6742\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f9d\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u673a\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens.

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan.

Includes 7 pages of supplementary material", "summary": "Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u8bcd\u957f\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6743\u8861\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u524d\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u672a\u6765\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u68c0\u9a8c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u8bcd\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8bcd\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6697\u793a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseRM\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4eceLLM\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3LLM\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5956\u52b1\u5934\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u597d\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSparseRM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseRM\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Adhering to the principles of \"quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation,\" the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of \"domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement\" for insurance large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUFEInse v1.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u300154\u4e2a\u5b50\u6307\u6807\u548c14,430\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u4ea7\u4e1a\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\"\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6db5\u76d6\u4fdd\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u7cbe\u7b97\u3001\u6838\u4fdd\u7406\u8d54\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u8425\u9500\u6587\u6848\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "CUFEInse\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5176\u5efa\u8bbe\u7406\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6743\u5a01\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\u4fdd\u9669\u5927\u6a21\u578b\"\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94+\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\"\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o.

A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting.

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDANS-KGC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5047\u9634\u6027\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff08DAM\uff09\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\uff08ANS\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff08DTM\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728UMLS\u548cYAGO3-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DANS-KGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment.

This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning.

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format.

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1).

A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation.

However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \\textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \\textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \\textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5916\u663e\u3001\u8033\u8bed\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\uff09\u4e2dtheta\u9891\u5e26\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5916\u663e\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u524d\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u97f3\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u800c\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u5219\u5448\u73b0\u66f4\u5c40\u9650\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8fd0\u52a8\u533a\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5916\u663e\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002theta\u9891\u6bb5\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u97f3\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684theta\u9891\u5e26\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5916\u663e\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u524d\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u5916\u663e\u53d1\u97f3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u97f3\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u97f3\u663e\u793a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u542c\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u5448\u73b0\u66f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u9650\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8fd0\u52a8\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "theta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u5916\u663e\u53d1\u97f3\u6d89\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8033\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u663e\u793a\u4e2d\u7b49\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u800c\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u989e\u9876\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u80cc\u540e\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals.

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0NOTAM\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840LLM\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534730.4%\u3002", "motivation": "NOTAM\uff08\u822a\u884c\u901a\u544a\uff09\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed9\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u60c5\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNOTAM-Evolve\u81ea\u6f14\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba9LLM\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u572810,000\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684NOTAM\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOTAM-Evolve\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "NOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6f14\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NOTAM\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English.

To appear in AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faST-SAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRMSE\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets.

As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u529f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u7ea7\u8054\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MLLM\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u6539\u8fdbMLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico.

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLMs\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u52a0\u5267\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u504f\u79bb\u751f\u7269\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u548c\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u94fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PrimeKGQA\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling.

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores.

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream.

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption.

Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8649\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u57285\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u95f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7600\u7bc7\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u6027\u522b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5176\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528600\u7bc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a(i) \u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c(ii) \u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u4f5c\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e866\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u64cd\u7eb5\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u7537-\u5973\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6bd4\u5973-\u7537\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u5927\uff09\u3002\u53ea\u6709GPT\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u7537\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u66f4\u591a\u81ea\u4e3b\u652f\u6301\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u66f4\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66GenAI\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684AI\u6cbb\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u7684LLM\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u63a5\u5730\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models.

However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528XAI\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6ce8\u5851\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574", "method": "\u5e94\u7528SHAP\u3001Grad-CAM\u548cLIME\u7b49XAI\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb19\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u522b\u964d\u7ef4\u81f39\u4e2a\u548c6\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u7279\u5f81\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u9014\u5f84"}}

Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4eba\u54cd\u5e94\u5f88\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u65b0\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e00LLM\u5185\u6539\u8fdb\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u76f8\u5173\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgentPRM\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u7edc\u8d2d\u7269\u548c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u7d22\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentPRM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgentPRM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa8\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentPRM\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u7ecf\u540c\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\\% under shortcut scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u89e3\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d32%\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534756%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation.

Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53e5\u5b50-\u624b\u52bf\u5bf9\u548c3000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8bcd\u548c\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f62\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684RAG\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u4e2atransformer\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u5230\u624b\u52bf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7BLEU\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cRWTH-PHOENIX-2014T\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness.

This paper introduces JobSphere, an AI-powered career assistant that is redefining the employment platform in Punjab called PGRKAM. JobSphere employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, and it is multilingual, available in English, Hindi and Punjabi. JobSphere technique uses 4-bit quantization, allowing the platform to deploy on consumer-grade GPUs (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 3050 4GB), making the implementation 89% cheaper than that of cloud-based systems. Key innovations include voice-enabled interaction with the assistant, automated mock tests, resume parsing with skills recognition, and embed-based job recommendation that achieves a precision@10 score of 68%. An evaluation of JobSphere's implementation reveals 94% factual accuracy, a median response time of 1.8 seconds, and a System Usability Scale score of 78.5/100, a 50% improvement compared to the baseline PGRKAM platform context. In conclusion, JobSphere effectively fills significant accessibility gaps for Punjab/Hindi-speaking users in rural locations, while also affirming the users access to trusted job content provided by government agencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "JobSphere\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u67b6\u6784\u4e3aPGRKAM\u5c31\u4e1a\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u5e9c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u5b58\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65c1\u906e\u666e\u5730\u533a\u7684\u519c\u6751\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u65c1\u906e\u666e\u8bed\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7b80\u5386\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b094%\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f41.8\u79d2\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u520678.5/100\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534750%\uff09\uff0c\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u7684precision@10\u8fbe\u523068%\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e89%\u3002", "conclusion": "JobSphere\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65c1\u906e\u666e/\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u5728\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u8bbf\u95ee\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5c31\u4e1a\u5185\u5bb9\u3002"}}

Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously.

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FaithEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cFaithAct\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6839\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FaithEval\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u548c\u94fe\u7ea7\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFaithAct\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFaithAct\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e8626%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable).

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u7136\u5927\u81f4\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5927\u81f4\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.
