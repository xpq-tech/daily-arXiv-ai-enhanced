A central\nquestion is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized\nfunctions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's\ncore cognitive abilities. We introduce \"cyclic ablation,\" an iterative method\nto test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and\nadversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of\ndeception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception\nwas highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior\nafter each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term\nfunctional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this \"neurosurgery\" caused\na gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by\na consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view\nthat complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the\nlimitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability."}

Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method."}

We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark\nproperty, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence\nacross subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model\nfamilies, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed\nacross models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable\nevaluation.

To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to\nDNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot\ncounts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based\nmodels in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups\nsuch as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared\nto DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among\nfairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the\nworst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing\ndemographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.\nIn contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but\nperforms less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps\nmitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of\nshots does not lead to further reductions in disparities.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing\nbelief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,\nshowing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs\nscale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from\n44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR\nand position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR."}

Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones.

Most existing approaches rely on manually\ndesigned processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.\nWhile a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied\nto specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate\nfeedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration.

Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning\nprocess by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement\nlearning trajectory.

Leveraging these\ninsights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic\nalgorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to\noptimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect\nlatent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking\nprocesses. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,\nand LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking\nprocesses. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward\nmodeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed\ndirectly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,\nefficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of\nLLMs."}

To effectively automate the design and\noptimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied.

CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,\nquantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating\ndevice-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments\nwere conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter\ncombinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM\narchitecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in\nenergy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement\nin TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x\nto 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of\n73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending\nthe framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to\nan 819.5x reduction in EDAP.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots.

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires\nsignificantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient\nto reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose\nthe Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying\ncomplexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model\nimproves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

Current attack methods on malicious instructions\nare often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting\nwith semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We\npropose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that\nexploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,\nour method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the\ntarget query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative\ntheory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while\nconcealing the malicious event as the hidden climax.

To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,\nan evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in\ngeneral and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model\nfamilies comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies\nacross models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe.

All problems are\nnewly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.\nEvery problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable\nanswer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for\nadvanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current\nstate-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain\nfar from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best\naverage accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),\nmoderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the\nrealistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large\ndisconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research\ndemands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically\ngrounded AI tools."}

Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification.

In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth\nablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as\nsupervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual\ncorrectness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven\nTruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,\nunderscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing\ntruthful LLMs."}

While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in\ncontexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently\nambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to\nrecognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter\ndecision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex\nsocial dilemmas.
