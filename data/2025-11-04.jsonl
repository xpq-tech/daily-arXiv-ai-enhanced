However, their ability to create complex visualiza-\ntions for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and\nunderdevel- oped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark\nfeaturing 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics,\nsuch as fi- nance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is\nstructured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48\ndistinct chart types. Cru- cially, it is the first to systematically evaluate\nboth single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum\nof task complexities. Our com- prehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on\nPlotCraft reveals obvious per- formance deficiencies in handling sophisticated\nvisualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K,\na large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized\nvia a collaborative agent frame- work. Building upon this dataset, we develope\nPlotCraftor, a novel code gener- ation model that achieves strong capabilities\nin complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval,\nPandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance\ncomparable to that of leading propri- etary approaches.

Through intrinsic\nmechanism analysis, we reveal that iterative paraphrasing creates an\nintermediate laundering region characterized by semantic displacement with\npreserved generation patterns, which brings up two attack categories:\nparaphrasing human-authored text (authorship obfuscation) and paraphrasing\nLLM-generated text (plagiarism evasion). To address these vulnerabilities, we\nintroduce PADBen, the first benchmark systematically evaluating detector\nrobustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. PADBen comprises a\nfive-type text taxonomy capturing the full trajectory from original content to\ndeeply laundered text, and five progressive detection tasks across\nsentence-pair and single-sentence challenges. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art\ndetectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the\nplagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives.

To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM\ncritic that can provide efficient and reliable assessments of constraint\nfollowing in the instructions. We first develop a checklist generator to\ndecompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance\nof the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a\nmulti-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level\npreference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong\nLLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini. With the scalable\nreward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance\ngains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead\ncompared to strong LLM critic baselines."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity.

We introduce RAGSmith, a modular\nframework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine\ntechnique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic\nsearch optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics\n(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic\nsimilarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law,\nFinance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions\nspanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds\nconfigurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\\% on\naverage (range +1.2\\% to +6.9\\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\\% in\nretrieval and +7.5\\% in generation. The search typically explores $\\approx\n0.2\\%$ of the space ($\\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone --\nvector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by\ndomain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt\nreordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude\ncorrelates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes\nthan interpretation-heavy sets. These results provide practical, domain-aware\nguidance for assembling effective RAG systems and demonstrate the utility of\nevolutionary search for full-pipeline optimization."}

The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior.

Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate\nplanning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model\nto carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive\nevaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard\nprompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for\nshorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying\nbenefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating\nup to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal\nthat our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to\nstandard prompting techniques. Our approach provides an immediately deployable\nsolution for applications requiring precise length control, particularly\nvaluable for production environments where model retraining is impractical or\ncost-prohibitive."}

Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning\nlength and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short\nreasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones\naccumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be\nfound ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space.

To address this, we propose DTS, a\nmodel-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by\nselectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to\nselect the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the\noptimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring\nadditional training or supervision.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nMulti-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language\nModels (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated\nnetwork troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the\nframework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution\nplanner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues\nand recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame.
