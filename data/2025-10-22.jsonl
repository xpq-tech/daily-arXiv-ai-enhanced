In a\nlarge-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100\ndecisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly\nthan humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more\npunishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;\nand critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased\npunishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,\nenforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,\nwhereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,\nDeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than\nfoundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.\nThese findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral\ndecisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness\njudgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses.

No single strategy excels universally,\nhighlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize\nperformance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT\n(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome\nthis constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the\nseamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,\nwhich employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent\nintegrators, unlocking the \"best of all worlds\" across tasks. Extensive\nempirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential\ndecision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The\nframework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution\nquality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines\nLLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy\ncalibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing\nthe boundaries of self-refining methodologies."}

To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established\nphilosophical tradition: \\textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through\nthesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a\nstructured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.\nUnlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model\nreaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate\ndistinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers\nsignificant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated\nbenchmarks like GSM and MMLU.

However, this only\nidentifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual\ninterpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.\nThis paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that\nmatch token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the\nlikelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into\nrule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be\nextracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they\nrepresent."}

In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs.

In psychological and social value theories such\nas Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple\nvalue dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods\nencounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:\n1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,\nignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)\nthey struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those\nunderrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we\npropose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE\nalignment.

Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels.

In AtlasKV, we\nintroduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with\nsub-linear time and memory complexity.

Key principles: (1) event as\nan act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models\n(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -\nthe order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)\nmaking the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring\ndeterminism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what\nfalls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the\ndeclarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of\nfixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms\n(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of\nhistory (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special\nattention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via\nschemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)\nwithout global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea\nsystem - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical\nconstructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language).

Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies.
