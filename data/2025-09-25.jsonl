The data source owner\ncreates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about\ndataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created\na prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the\nmetadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some\nfeatures that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that\nrepresent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading\nand parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and\ngrouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for\nthe LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this\nearly prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,\nfor which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses\ncontaining hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that\nit is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code\ninterpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by\nHedgehog's developer.

Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for\ndynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing\nresponses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations.

Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at\nintersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.\nTraditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and\ncontext-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due\nto their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited\ninterpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for\nextracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling\nof driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal\nLLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,\nstructured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and\ncontext-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application\nof modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art\nLLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves\nthe highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These\nfindings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and\ncomputational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in\nreal-world pedestrian safety systems."}

Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i)\nTask 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task:\nConversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines\nan extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based\nmodels, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual\nand sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we\ndesigned a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered\npersonas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of\ndialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams\nbased on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were\namong the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early\ndetection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for\noptimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st\nplace out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all\nevaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR.

A key challenge is the large\ntoken overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the\nprobability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared\nuseful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.\nAs a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory\nunder the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect\nof the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect\ntakes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has\nbegun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)\npreference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in\nthe regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,\nlogit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA\nenables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic\ngradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH\nand GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest\nimprovements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%.

We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based\nmodels across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and\nextractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.\nnon-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that\nTP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and\nmorphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance\nin semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,\nincluding tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,\nreveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper\nmismatches at the script or token level."}

The compute for pre-training LLMs has been\ngrowing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data\nremains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data\nconstitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that\ncertain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model\ncapacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally\ncomplex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented\nPre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with\nautomatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively\nincreases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more\nlearnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across\ndiverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training\nwith both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong\nopen-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and\nfamilies. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a\nfactor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training\nperformance by over $10\\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks."}

We\nidentify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of\nimplicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens\nto enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and\ncollapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent\nrepresentations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a\nfailure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT\napproaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training\nmodule that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the\nlatent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder\nduring training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit\nreasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful\ninformation. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,\npreserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added\noverhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of\nimplicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning\nvocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.\nSIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain\nstability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by\n+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B.

A comprehensive study (N\n= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant\nperformance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller\nopen-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\nexhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all\nconditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In\ncontrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%\naccuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation\nunder context saturation ($\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These\nfindings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor\nto reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under\nuncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as\nexemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true\nresilience and safety of advanced AI systems."}

In\nthis work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating\nuser-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with\nsimulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and\ntrajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect\nlearning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal\nthree key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial\ninteraction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate\ntrajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;\nand (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,\nopen-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and\ntransferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of\nreward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and\nestablish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric\nagentic models.

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models\n(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs\nempower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing\nhigh-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions\ninto embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building\ninternal representations and future predictions of the external world,\nfacilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper\ncomprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,\ncovering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,\nembodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,\nmeticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied\ncognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the\nabove advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint\nMLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound\nsignificance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we\nexamine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide\napplicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future\nresearch directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation."}

Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic\nrouting that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing\noperational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task\ndecomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks\ninto DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering\nthat groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for\nk-round refinement before synthesis.
