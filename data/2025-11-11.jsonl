This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation."}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities."}

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance."}

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization."}

In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand.

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models."}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs."}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems."}

Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench.

Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks.

In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities.

Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones."}

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks."}

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios."}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline."}

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best."}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently."}

To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift."}

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself."}

PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies.

These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP."}

Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision.

While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness. This study highlights the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs and offers a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment."}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs."}

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments."}

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities."}

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows."}

ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA).

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications."}

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks."}

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules. Our results establish model-internal confidence as a robust, domain-agnostic signal for model routing, offering a scalable pathway for efficient LLM deployment."}

We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions."}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications."}

However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software."}

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements."}

EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks."}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning."}

While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks.

We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios.

For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt."}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems."}

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs."}

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback.

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection."}

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision."}

In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation."}

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN."}

This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200.

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales.

Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence.

Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting.

It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis.

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy."}

We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks."}

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance."}

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies.

Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions."}

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series."}

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence.

Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications."}

Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies."}

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols."}

To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking."}

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way."}

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning."}

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%.

Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding.

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks.

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models."}

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language."}

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality."}

Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups.

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ ."}

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios."}

SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline."}

Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety.

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently."}

Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself."}

Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model.

In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly.

Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training."}

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models."}

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation."}

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions."}

To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement.

We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale."}

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks."}

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations."}

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection."}

This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset.

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting."}

Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions."}

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols."}

These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning."}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs."}

Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The experimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems."}

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs."}

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs."}

We introduce TransGraph, a discourse-guided framework that explicitly models inter-chunk relationships through structured discourse graphs and selectively conditions each translation segment on relevant graph neighbourhoods rather than relying on sequential or exhaustive context. Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead."}

We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development."}

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations."}

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements."}

Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment."}
