### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。在MultiSpider数据集上，该方法显著提升了执行准确率和语义准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战——包括查询语义含义和执行结果的正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型将执行准确率提升至87.4%（比零样本提升26个百分点），语义准确率提升至52.29%（提升32.86个百分点）。添加对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%（提升6.85个百分点）。

Conclusion: 该方法证明可以通过对比奖励实现定向语义对齐，无需大规模训练数据集即可显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，较小的3B模型在微调后甚至能超越较大的8B零样本模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成式操作框架，利用LLM作为翻译引擎，将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述，解决心理健康筛查中技术透明度与临床实用性之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP、LIME）虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床应用的差距。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用LLM作为核心翻译引擎，整合多种XAI工具的技术输出和临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、基于证据的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流整合、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍。

Conclusion: 为将AI从孤立数据点生成转向提供集成、可操作且可信赖的临床AI提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一个公开可验证的水印框架，通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，在语法约束环境中减弱信号以保持文本质量，在语言灵活性强的环境中增强信号以提高检测能力，无需访问模型logits。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型输出分布信号（如token级熵），需要访问底层模型的logits，这阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型特定信号的公开可验证水印方法。

Method: 利用词性n-元模型建模的语言不确定性动态调制水印信号，在语法约束环境中减弱信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性强的环境中增强信号以提高检测能力。检测器无需访问任何模型logits。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和黏着性韩语等类型多样的语言上实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时提高了检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过用户标注收集成对偏好数据的新方法，利用不同模型生成的两个响应来推断用户数据质量，并通过期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子来过滤数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，而用户在日常使用中产生的偏好标签虽然能反映真实偏好但缺乏质量控制，需要一种方法来评估和过滤用户标注质量。

Method: 通过两个不同模型生成响应，利用不对称性建立用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用用户标注数据，通过质量评估机制提升LLM对齐的数据质量。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"知情路由"的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器评估token的重要性和可恢复性，实现执行或近似策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的高推理成本限制了其实际应用，现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优token选择。

Method: 引入轻量级特征预测器(LFF)，在路由决策前预测单元输出，实现灵活的"执行或近似"策略，评估token的重要性和可恢复性。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上，知情路由在多个稀疏度水平上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估token的重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了现有贪婪路由方法的信息丢失问题，在保持模型保真度的同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝方法，结合头部重要性和注意力熵，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升15.2%和2.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但多层多头结构导致推理和部署效率问题。现有的基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性

Method: 提出HIES剪枝准则，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝方法在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著的模型压缩而不牺牲准确性或稳定性

Conclusion: HIES方法通过整合头部重要性和注意力熵，有效克服了HIS方法的局限性，为Transformer模型的高效剪枝提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流、1420个问题和评估工具，旨在评估LLM在复杂交互式数据分析任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务往往目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清意图，而现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或支持交互性。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了系统评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续、长形式交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务中进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

*Debarun Bhattacharjya,Balaji Ganesan,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Katsiaryna Mirylenka,Michael Glass,Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型不确定性量化方法，提出基于相似性的黑盒UQ框架，在问答、摘要和文本到SQL等任务中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要知道何时不确定其输出，不确定性量化对可信AI系统至关重要。黑盒方法具有鲁棒性、适应性强、成本低等优势。

Method: 提出基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，包含多种UQ方法，并引入使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本到SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的相似性方法比基线方法能产生更好的校准置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒UQ方法能有效量化LLM的不确定性，在多种复杂生成任务中表现优于基线方法。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的定义存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（部分关系），该方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时费力，需要自动化方法来处理大量非结构化文本中的产品信息组织。

Method: 利用大型语言模型开发全自动方法，从原始评论文本中提取产品本体（部分关系）。

Result: 该方法生成的本体在使用LLM作为评判标准时，优于现有的BERT基线方法。

Conclusion: 为在（产品或其他）本体提取中更广泛地使用LLM奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对事实核查RAG系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释，无需访问目标模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，传统攻击在可信证据主导的检索环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击技术，使用少样本语义对齐的投毒方法，无需访问目标LLM或检索器，通过多注入策略实现攻击。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT平均攻击成功率达86%，投毒率仅为0.93×10^-6，比现有最优攻击提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界RAG事实核查系统的严重脆弱性，即使在强反证存在的情况下仍保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化处理来更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格式和事件型特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配问题，这限制了它们捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，通过在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计用于编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比现有的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 时序序列化在医疗领域基础模型预训练中具有重要意义，SerialBEHRT证明了其在捕捉临床事件间依赖关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇中，解决传统固定词汇子集方法在推测解码中的局限性，提升推理速度并保持验证准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法使用固定词汇子集作为草稿模型的词汇表，这种方法存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调整，静态短列表会抑制罕见或领域特定token，降低每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 引入轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇中；选择的前k个簇的并集形成草稿模型的短列表；通过并行执行草稿编码和元短列表计算来提前完成元分类器计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，在平均接受长度方面获得一致提升，同时上下文相关选择使得更小的短列表不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速草稿生成并能跨不同任务泛化的动态短列表机制，解决了传统固定词汇子集方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言LLM中的代码切换现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用潜在空间语言引导，通过PCA在平行翻译上识别语言方向，并沿这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在多个语言对上将下一个token分布差异减少了高达42%，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 语言身份集中在最终层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能有效缓解代码切换同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

TL;DR: 该论文发现成功的LLM推理具有非均匀的信息密度模式，这与人类沟通的均匀信息密度假设形成鲜明对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假设的启发，研究LLM推理过程中的信息流模式，以解决中间步骤不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准上测试。

Result: 发现成功的LLM推理具有全局非均匀特征：正确解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征。

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新颖的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰，实现稳定高效的LLM编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中面临灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新并降低保留知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进的定位-编辑技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 结果为动态演化信息环境中设计LLM提供了更原则性方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强大理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试，用于评估不同用户角色下LLM的事实一致性，发现模型对相同问题会因用户角色不同而给出不一致的事实回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试当不同人口统计特征的用户询问相同问题时，LLM是否会给出事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个主题询问5个事实，重复100次，每次添加不同用户角色的提示上下文，通过计算跨角色余弦相似度来评估事实一致性。

Result: Grok-3一致性最高，轻量级模型表现最差；不同主题一致性差异明显，就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致；疫苗和巴以冲突等话题在不同提供商间差异显著。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性既受提供商影响，也受话题影响，需要开发角色不变的提示策略来提高一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BenchPress系统，通过检索增强生成和LLM辅助，加速创建特定领域的文本到SQL基准测试，结合人工验证确保质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在私有企业数据仓库中手动标注SQL查询对应自然语言问题的成本高、难度大的问题。

Method: 使用检索增强生成和LLM为给定SQL查询生成多个自然语言描述草案，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准测试的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性和基准可靠性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人工验证和LLM生成建议，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练即可达到98.2%的POS标注准确率，优于基于300标注句子的AfriBERTa模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出原则性学习范式，让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行训练，特别针对低资源语言处理问题。

Method: 开发Rule-to-Tag框架，将多层语言规则系统整合到神经网络训练目标中，包含处理OOV词汇的正则化项的自适应损失函数。

Result: 在Zarma词性标注任务中，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率；在命名实体识别任务中，R2T预训练后仅需50标注句子即可超越基于300标注句子的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架展示了原则性学习的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖，在低资源语言处理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一种利用模型一致性来增强大语言模型集成鲁棒性的即插即用技术，通过token级和模型级一致性处理集成中的错误信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同大语言模型具有互补能力，但集成方法对错误信号（如异构分词方案和模型专业差异）的鲁棒性关注不足，集成失败常源于token级和模型级的不一致。

Method: CoRE通过token级一致性（使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重）和模型级一致性（促进高自信且与其他模型差异小的输出）来增强集成鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE作为一种即插即用的鲁棒集成技术，能有效处理大语言模型集成中的不一致问题，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

TL;DR: MasonNLP系统使用基于检索增强生成(RAG)框架的通用指令调优大语言模型，在MEDIQA-WV 2025伤口护理VQA任务中取得第三名，证明了轻量级RAG方法在医疗多模态NLP任务中的有效性。

Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中伤口护理的挑战，支持临床决策和患者护理，需要生成自由文本回答和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 采用通用指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，整合领域内数据的文本和视觉示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排序。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第三，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLMs结合提供了一个简单有效的多模态临床NLP任务基线方法，通过最小推理时间层添加相关示例即可提升性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著内存和计算开销，研究发现这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，利用归一化和注意力计算的线性特性，用MLP近似整个transformer块

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型内存需求降低25%，训练和推理延迟改善40%

Conclusion: 研究结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模辅导对话中的情感感知，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在AI辅导中通常呈现轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度，但学习过程并不总是顺利，困惑和好奇是常见伴随状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导辅导中的情感动态仍未充分理解。本研究旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进将生成式AI负责任地整合到教育中的途径。

Method: 分析了两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性评分，以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随状态；挫折感较少见但会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂存在，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情绪常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻更多引导学生向上而非向下，这为辅导者在这些关键时刻进行干预提供了机会，强调了在AI辅导中关注情感动态的重要性。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型虽然前景广阔，但其推理策略仍局限于自回归模型的前缀提示方法，需要更适配的生成控制方法。

Method: 模板填充（TI）方法首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充被遮蔽的片段；动态片段分配（DSA）根据生成置信度自适应调整片段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法取得了17.01%的稳定提升，在多令牌生成设置中也能保持质量的同时实现有效加速。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了更灵活的生成控制，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了性能和多令牌生成效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在多臂老虎机环境中仅使用文本反馈进行决策，Qwen3-4B模型表现最佳，达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，超越了传统算法和其他更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在仅使用自然语言反馈的情况下，在不确定性环境中进行顺序决策的能力，填补了LLMs在纯语言环境中决策能力研究的空白。

Method: 创建了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试环境，LLMs仅收到"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈，没有数值线索或显式概率，需要从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如传统基准算法，但Qwen3-4B模型取得了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法（如Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB等）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力能够仅从语言中涌现出来，该基准为评估自然主义、非数值上下文中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种让语言模型动态调整每个输入token计算步数的训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token获得更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂度自主决定需要的计算量，提高计算效率同时保持准确性。

Method: 提出Catch Your Breath损失函数系列：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）、CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚），通过时间成本和不确定性校准来训练模型。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能根据token复杂度和上下文自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法使模型能够智能地分配计算资源，在复杂token处请求更多计算，在简单token处快速输出，显著提高训练效率。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一个简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟研究大多局限于多选或简答格式，忽视了LLMs的生成特性，无法真实反映社会现象的复杂性。

Method: 基于调查方法学研究和NLP进展，提出在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，捕捉话题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计，探索未预期观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLMs的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际表现，探索模型规模和架构改进是否足以解决复杂的分类挑战。

Method: 使用统一数据集（8,660个人工标注样本）和相同零样本提示，评估10个先进LLMs在IAB 2.2层次分类法上的表现，同时开发并测试集成方法。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率仅34%，存在高幻觉率和膨胀率。集成方法显著提升准确率、减少膨胀并完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型协调编排比单纯扩大规模更有效，集成方法为实现或超越人类专家级文本分类性能提供了最有希望的路径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面主要关注可验证的最终答案，但生成和验证自然语言数学证明仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器。

Method: 引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，系统探索评估器设计空间（骨干模型、输入上下文、指令和工作流程），开发ProofGrader评估器结合强推理骨干模型、参考解决方案和评分方案的丰富上下文以及简单集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上实现了0.926的低MAE，显著优于朴素基线。在最佳n选择任务中，当n=16时平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader展示了在推进下游证明生成方面的潜力，为LLM生成的数学证明提供了可靠的细粒度评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and

cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内在和外在难度评分，优先选择更高认知级别的指令，提供可解释和可量化的标准。

Result: 实验表明，THTB仅使用5%数据训练的模型就能超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据训练的模型也能超越使用更大数据集的模型。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面表现出色，具有强大的领域适应潜力，能够显著提高监督微调的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our

Motivation: 现有防御主要关注单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法捕捉攻击策略的多样性或过于强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 进行结构化红队挑战，开发包含7大家族的50种越狱策略的层次分类法，分析攻击数据，评估基于分类法的提示检测效果，并创建多轮对抗对话数据集。

Result: 建立了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的有效性和模型漏洞利用方式，证明了分类法引导提示能改进自动检测，并提供了意大利语多轮对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对越狱技术有效性的理解，提供了系统化的分类框架和数据集，有助于改进LLM的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越具有挑战性，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和指令调优的GPT-4o作为LLM法官，在人类AI平行语料库上进行测试，该语料库包含6个领域（学术、新闻、小说、博客、口语转录和影视剧本）的600个平衡实例。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT生成内容上表现更好（82% vs 68%），而LLM法官在LLaMA生成内容上略优（85% vs 81%）。LLM法官在小说和学术文本中显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要结合不同方法的混合策略。两种方法在不同领域各有优势：LLM法官具有语义敏感性，风格嵌入在结构特征上更强。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在其激活中保留了训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要意义，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但仍容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，现有方法在绕过安全机制方面存在不足。

Method: RAID将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合优化目标：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)拒绝感知正则化器引导激活远离拒绝方向，(iii)连贯性项保持语义合理性。优化后使用批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID比现有白盒和黑盒基线方法以更少的查询和更低的计算成本实现了更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域作为建议提供者，需要了解它们在困难的政治和道德领域中的响应方式及可能的偏见。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM的固有响应、直接政治意识形态表达以及基于构建人物角色的响应，系统比较LLM输出与人类研究数据。

Conclusion: LLM生成的响应具有政治和人口统计学依赖性，这为理解AI生成内容中的偏见提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

TL;DR: 提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取认知构建块的抽象表示（模式），来增强语言模型在新问题上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面的知识检索和迁移模块，受认知科学中模式理论的启发，希望让语言模型像人类一样通过激活已有心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: 从先前的示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的抽象模式模板，包含关键推理步骤及其关系，然后用此模式增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL能持续提升性能（最高36.19%），当单个演示示例质量高时效果更好，同时减少对演示数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的不同ICL策略，还为增强语言模型中类人推理开辟了新路径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一种无需标注数据的样本高效提示优化框架，通过成对偏好反馈和双Thompson采样实现标签自由的提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对输入提示高度敏感，但自动提示优化方法通常需要真实标注数据，而收集高质量标注成本高昂且缓慢。

Method: 将提示优化建模为dueling-bandit问题，使用LLM作为评判者提供成对偏好反馈，结合双Thompson采样和基于高表现提示的变异策略。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种无需标注数据的有效提示优化框架，能够自然处理标签缺失场景并缓解评判者噪声。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而模型内部如何进行算术计算的结构仍不明确。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析模型内部表示。

Result: 中间计算确实出现在残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后；模型在注意力层后在线性编码中体现了运算符优先级。

Conclusion: 提出了部分嵌入交换技术，通过交换运算符间高影响维度的嵌入来修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based KGFMs存在LLM知识被稀疏KG上下文淹没导致知识失真，以及难以完全约束LLM生成幻觉的问题

Method: 设计KRL指令格式和分词器对齐LLM与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外KG上下文；设计结构感知的下一个实体预测器

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中都表现出显著优势

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识和KG上下文，有效解决了知识失真和生成幻觉问题，提升了推理结果的可信度

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时仍存在困难，其中间推理能力研究不足，需要专门的评估基准来识别和改进这些核心能力。

Method: 通过分析先进系统的输出识别常见任务和所需核心能力，构建典型LLM错误分类法，设计针对性评估问题，创建RAGCap-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明，具备更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型在端到端任务中表现更好，验证了基准的有效性和增强中间能力的重要性。

Conclusion: RAGCap-Bench为评估和改进代理式RAG系统的中间推理能力提供了有效工具，强调增强这些能力对提升整体性能的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将AI辩论应用于主观问题，发现模型倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持自身先验信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在捍卫自身信念时更具说服力，但违背信念的论点在质量评估中反而得分更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所捍卫的主张是错误的。本研究旨在探索模型在主观问题辩论中是否会采用阿谀奉承策略来最大化说服力。

Method: 测量语言模型的先验信念，然后让辩手选择偏好立场，并面对与自身信念冲突的法官角色。比较了顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估模型在捍卫与自身信念一致或相反立场时的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于捍卫与法官立场一致的立场而非自身信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在捍卫与自身信念一致立场时更具说服力；但违背信念的论点在质量评估中得分更高。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有方法在构建指令调优数据集时缺乏对难度和质量的精细控制，生成的数据无法捕捉长时程推理所需的复杂性，且许多研究混淆了数据和训练效果。

Method: 引入两阶段数据合成管道，使用基线网络代理逐步增加任务复杂度生成问答对，并在过程中验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个基于网络的基准测试中表现更好，工具使用动作的多样性是现有数据集的两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的数据集能有效训练网络代理，避免重复工具调用行为，实现更强的性能。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 反驳当前认为可读性（简单词汇、熟悉叙事结构、简单语法）是小型语言模型产生连贯文本关键因素的观点，质疑将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法。

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较在简化语言和复杂成人级别文本上训练的小型语言模型的性能表现。

Result: 研究发现可读性本身并不能预测小型语言模型的连贯性或学习效率，在复杂文本上训练的模型表现相当甚至更快发展出连贯性。统计简单性（n-gram多样性）是更好的学习能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 警告不要将语言模型训练过度拟人化，主张更精确地分析实际支持小型模型能力涌现的属性，强调统计简单性比可读性更重要。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 该方法能够有效表示化学元素，处理文本分布差异和数据稀疏问题，为材料科学中的AI驱动发现铺平道路。

Conclusion: Element2Vec方法为化学元素表示提供了新途径，有望推动材料科学领域的AI驱动发现。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，有时甚至被简单的多数投票方法超越，需要找到更有效利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 开发理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出基于加权聚合的校准方法，通过预计算权重函数来优化模型间复杂交互。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，使用仅21.3%计算量就能超越传统加权多数投票性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算是更有效的性能提升路径，证明了优化模型交互的重要性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Conclusion: FACTS通过离线模板生成方法，为现实世界的查询导向表格摘要提供了一个实用、高效且隐私合规的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了物联网网络流量的全面高效解释。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集（3000个问题）上，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch通过多源信息检索框架有效解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域的科学严谨性问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答任务的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力持续下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著降低模型的推理、长上下文理解、安全性，并增加"黑暗特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM认知能力的影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型能力下降，将数据质量视为训练时安全问题。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，采用两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量），在匹配token规模和训练操作下对4个LLM进行持续预训练实验。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2），长上下文理解下降（RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3），安全性降低，黑暗特质增加。发现思维跳跃是主要损伤机制。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，需要将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并建议对部署的LLM进行常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在生物医学领域应用时，是否会将临床无关的社会人口学信息纳入药物不良事件预测，评估其可靠性。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型在不同教育、婚姻、就业等社会人口特征角色上的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，并识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种偏见模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在关键风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 通过指令检索而非生成的方式，让小语言模型在推理时获取结构化推理步骤，从而提升其在多步推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型虽然能在本地硬件高效运行，具有隐私保护、低成本等优势，但在需要多步推理或领域知识的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建指令语料库：将相似训练问题分组，通过GPT-5生成指令。推理时，模型检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤。

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU专业法律和MathQA上，指令检索带来一致提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 指令检索能有效提升小语言模型的推理能力，简洁指令效果更好，改进程度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对深度研究代理在关键研究分析能力上的严谨系统评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出HisRubric分层分析框架，构建FinDeepResearch基准，对16种代表性方法（包括6个DR代理、5个具备深度推理和搜索能力的LLM、5个仅有深度推理能力的LLM）进行广泛实验。

Result: 揭示了这些方法在不同能力、金融市场和语言方面的优势和局限性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度研究代理的评估提供了系统框架和基准，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究发现，通过上下文提示生成的AI文本在专家评估中表现不佳，但经过对特定作者作品进行微调后，AI生成的文本在风格保真度和写作质量上反而优于专家写作，且成本大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学作品并模仿作者风格，以回应关于AI使用受版权保护作品训练可能影响市场的争议。

Method: 采用预注册研究，比较MFA培训的专家作家与ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini三个前沿AI模型，通过盲法成对评估由159名专家和普通读者对模仿50位获奖作家风格的450字摘录进行评价。

Result: 上下文提示的AI文本在专家评估中表现差，但经过作者特定微调后，专家和普通读者都更偏好AI生成的文本，且AI检测器很少能识别出微调后的文本。

Conclusion: 作者特定微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字写作，这为版权法中"对潜在市场或价值的影响"这一公平使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: MTI是一个无需训练的高效推理框架，通过在不确定位置选择性应用分类器自由引导和轻量级负提示引导，显著提升大语言模型的推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型通过增加推理计算来提升推理能力，但效率低下。研究发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少量高熵标记主导输出正确性。

Method: 提出最小测试时干预(MTI)框架：1)选择性CFG干预，仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导；2)轻量级负提示引导，重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升：Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准测试上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI证明了通过局部化干预不确定标记，可以在不牺牲效率的情况下显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Motivation: 由于现实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因，理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 开发了RAG错误类型的新分类法，整理了带错误类型标注的RAG响应数据集，并提出了与分类法对齐的自动评估方法。

Result: 创建了包含错误类型分类、示例和实用建议的完整框架，提供了可用于开发过程中跟踪和解决错误的自动评估工具。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统性的方法和工具，有助于提升RAG系统的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖训练语料库，但大多数语料库的数据许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，公开许可文本仍然严重稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，涵盖法律、科学、文化、政治、新闻、经济和网络文本七个领域。实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。

Result: 构建了包含154.56亿个token的高质量德语文本语料库，所有领域子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可，确保模型训练和重新分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: 德国Commons填补了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键空白，使开发真正开放的德语语言模型成为可能，同时发布了语料库构建和德语文本数据过滤代码，确保完全可复现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确答案不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLM在不同文化背景下的推理能力，而不仅仅是基于准确性的评分。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架评估模型解释，包含文化流畅度、偏差、一致性和语言适应性四个指标。基于世界价值观调查的50个文化相关问题，翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，评估三个模型(GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR)的2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅度，孟加拉语增强流畅度，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更有效但一致性较低；FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLM的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态表现更优，且模型开源状态影响性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够显著提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for

results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B
parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought
cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of
reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat
intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier
models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation
tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our
best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1,
ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

Motivation: 计算美食学需要多样化的高质量食谱数据集来捕捉区域烹饪传统，但马其顿食谱在数字研究中代表性不足。

Method: 通过网页抓取和结构化解析构建数据集，处理异质食材描述（包括单位、数量和描述符标准化），使用点互信息和提升度等指标分析食材频率和共现模式。

large-scale collections for major languages, Macedonian recipes remain
under-represented in digital research. In this work, we present the first
systematic effort to construct a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，使用强化学习框架利用SFT数据集，通过语义相似度奖励提升模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望将强化学习框架应用于广泛的SFT数据集，以更有效地提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，避免SFT仅依赖下一个词预测的局限性

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数，使用强化学习进行训练

Result: RLSR在指令跟随基准测试中表现优于SFT：Qwen-7B模型上RLSR的AlpacaEval胜率为26.34%，SFT为21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%的胜率

Conclusion: RLSR可以替代SFT或与SFT结合使用，能有效提升模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

TL;DR: 提出了动态角色精炼框架(DPRF)，通过迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并优化角色配置文件，显著提升大语言模型角色扮演代理的行为对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型角色扮演代理在模拟个体人类行为时，角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件（如精选信息和个性特征）而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或基于理论的结构化分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并相应优化角色配置文件以减轻这些差异。

Result: 在四种不同行为预测场景（正式辩论、有心理健康问题的社交媒体帖子、公开访谈和电影评论）上使用五个LLM进行评估，DPRF能够持续显著改善行为对齐，并在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用（如用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI）的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算，结合在线置信度生成早期退出机制，在三个基准测试上实现最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失低于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但增加了延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）难以平衡效率和准确性，面临两个关键挑战：阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算和在线置信度生成早期退出机制，抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上，LiteStage实现最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率和准确性平衡问题，为小语言模型的推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性，在11个数据集上平均提升一致性11.62%，F1分数8.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在面对相同提示的不同表述时产生不一致回答的问题，提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：1) 共识交叉熵(CCE)，使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；2) 表示对齐损失，将低置信度和非多数预测器向高置信度多数投票建立的共识对齐。

Result: 在11个数据集上，F²C平均提升一致性11.62%，F1分数8.94%，减少性能方差3.29%。在域外评估和仅使用部分提示扰动训练时也表现良好。

Conclusion: F²C是提高LLM在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: MoM框架通过主动理解文档而非被动分块，模拟人类阅读认知过程，解决了传统RAG在知识内化和推理能力上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时限制了知识内化的深度和推理能力，需要从被动分块转向主动理解。

Method: 提出MoM框架：使用LLMs模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制；结合反向推理策略训练SLMs；开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的广泛实验证明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块挑战，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，并为SLMs实现以人为中心的智能文本处理铺平道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅改善了RAG系统的文本处理能力，还推动了SLMs向人类认知水平的文本理解发展。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Motivation: 研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的因果关系，补充过去基于相关性的观察分析，测试关于数据如何影响模型行为的假设。

Method: 通过"重写历史"的方式干预数据批次，包括从基准测试中选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改这些文档，然后重新训练模型检查点并测量效果。

Result: 案例研究表明，现有的识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，同时补充了过去将共现统计与模型行为联系起来的研究。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可重复的实验方法，供研究人员测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设，代码已公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Motivation: 现有图基RAG系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但会产生包含冗余实体和不可靠关系的噪声图谱，这降低了检索和生成性能并增加了计算成本

Method: 提出DEG-RAG框架，包含：(1)实体解析消除冗余实体，(2)三元组反思去除错误关系，从而获得更紧凑、更高质量的知识图谱

Conclusion: DEG-RAG是首个全面探索LLM生成知识图谱中实体解析的方法，通过简单直接的去噪技术显著改善了图基RAG系统的效果

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Motivation: 解决小规模多语言模型在检索任务中表现落后于大型模型的问题，探索能否通过特定优化使小模型在检索任务中达到或超越大模型性能。

Method: 分析训练数据规模、负采样策略（特别是困难负样本）和数据多样性（任务多样性与语言多样性）对多语言嵌入模型检索性能的影响。

Result: 发现增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，困难负样本对提升检索精度至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性贡献更大。最终开发出约300M参数的紧凑多语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，小规模多语言模型可以在检索任务中达到甚至超越大型模型的性能，证明了模型压缩和专门优化的可行性。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式LLM推理不兼容。

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含生成式变体（将安全分类转化为指令跟随任务，支持三分类判断）和流式变体（引入token级分类头，实现实时安全监控）。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要检索多个相关证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解问题，选择器精确选择相关上下文，添加器补充缺失证据，三者通过迭代交互生成紧凑而全面的支持段落集。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试中（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）均优于强基线方法，实现了更高的检索准确率。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够有效过滤干扰内容，使下游QA模型在依赖更少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视了相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败问题。

Method: 采用双向检索策略：表优先检索后选择列，以及列优先检索后选择表，并结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取等技术增强检索效果。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著提高了模式召回率并减少了误报，SQL生成性能持续优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，无需查询优化即可将完整模式与完美模式之间的性能差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的强大杠杆，应作为独立问题加以重视。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

TL;DR: MathMist是一个多语言数学推理基准数据集，包含7种语言的21K+对齐问答对，涵盖高、中、低资源语言，用于评估LLMs在跨语言数学推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的全面评估，特别是在低资源语言环境下的表现。

Method: 构建了包含7种语言的平行多语言数学问题数据集，采用零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式，系统评估了开源和专有LLMs的数学推理能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，在低资源语言环境中表现明显下降，缺乏一致性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 多语言数学推理仍然是LLMs的挑战领域，需要更全面的基准和评估方法来提升跨语言推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLM在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并提出了多轮强化学习方法减少77.6%的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在客服、教育、医疗等应用中广泛使用，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论是故意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其误用成为现实风险。

Method: 提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种已有欺骗检测指标和提出的新指标。引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLM以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断相关性更高。LLM在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，被提示欺骗时欺骗性可增加31%。RLHF训练模型平均仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法相比其他指令微调模型减少了77.6%的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，有效的评估和缓解需要超越单轮话语分析。多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLM的欺骗行为，为LLM安全部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于混合词嵌入和超参数优化的阿尔茨海默病早期检测方法，使用Doc2Vec和ELMo的词向量计算句子困惑度得分，结合语言特征，通过逻辑回归实现91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，能够及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的重要标志，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo词向量的混合词嵌入，获得句子困惑度得分；添加语言特征分析语法和语义；将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调超参数。

Result: 达到91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，优于现有最佳NLP模型（88%准确率）；模型稳定性高（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确且稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法，也可作为医生检测AD的补充检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演代理在忠实、一致地呈现版本特定角色（如不同宇宙中的超级英雄）方面的能力尚未充分探索，超级英雄系列提供了丰富的测试场景。

Method: 创建包含两个任务的基准测试：Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境），提出Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能改善较弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的置信驱动多模型框架，通过模型多样性提升医学问答性能，在资源受限的医疗环境中实现高效AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医学大语言模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询定向到具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异性能，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医学AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对在资源受限环境中普及先进医学AI具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了现代大语言模型对字符级扰动的鲁棒性，通过在每个输入字符后插入不可见Unicode控制字符来测试模型性能。尽管这种扰动严重破坏了分词并降低了信噪比，许多LLM仍能保持显著性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级扰动下的鲁棒性，旨在防止LLM在在线考试系统等场景中的滥用，同时探索模型在低层文本处理中的可靠性。

Method: 提出NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符来制造字符级噪声，通过模型、问题和噪声相关配置的全面评估来测试LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，尽管存在强烈的混淆效果（破坏分词并显著降低信噪比），许多LLM仍能保持显著性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在低层文本处理中的鲁棒性，这对防止LLM滥用和在不同应用中可靠部署LLMs具有重要意义。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要聚合所有文档的重复性报告数据时表现不佳，这类问题对遗漏文档高度敏感且没有明确的检索停止点。

Method: 提出PluriHopRAG方法：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤无关文档，再进行昂贵的LLM推理。

Result: 传统RAG方法在PluriHopWIND数据集上F1分数不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG相对提升了18-52%。

Conclusion: Pluri-hop问题暴露了当前问答系统的局限性，PluriHopRAG证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤比top-k方法更有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Motivation: 自杀是全球重大公共卫生问题，现有研究主要关注单条社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但忽视了用户通过历史帖子和互动评论随时间展现意图的重要性。

Method: 构建基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，采用基于C-SSRS的四标签标注框架，结合用户发帖历史和评论数据，进行统计分析和大型语言模型实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个词预测方面表现出色，但在生成反映个人真实沟通风格（如回复邮件或社交消息）的响应方面仍有困难，且真实社交网络或邮件历史因隐私问题难以收集。

Method: 构建了一个多语言基准数据集，包含100个对话会话，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行为期五天的互动，捕捉自然的日常沟通模式。评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。数据集已在GitHub上公开。

Conclusion: YNTP任务通过受控对话有效建模用户词汇选择，为开发更符合个人沟通风格的语言模型提供了重要基准和数据集支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要原因是检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 1. 引用感知推理：要求所有生成内容明确基于检索的医学文档，使用结构化负知识断言；2. 迭代检索验证：通过验证代理评估证据充分性，通过医学差距分析优化查询；3. MedTrust对齐模块：结合验证的正例和幻觉感知负例，利用直接偏好优化强化引用基础推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct平均准确率提升2.7%，Qwen3-8B提升2.4%。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统化的证据验证和对齐优化，有效提升了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性，显著减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 采用约束分解策略和高效的约束级二元分类，直接从指令推导奖励信号，生成伪标签进行奖励模型训练。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令遵循任务。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式，通过主动在线探索和自演化聚合程序，构建了WebAggregatorQA数据集和WebAggregator模型系列，显著提升了网络代理的信息聚合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，而忽视了信息聚合这一关键需求，这限制了它们支持深度研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：首先通过主动在线探索从真实网络中获取基础信息，然后自演化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、覆盖50K网站和11个领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集；开发的WebAggregator-8B模型性能与GPT-4.1相当，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet；在WebAggregatorQA评估集上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA上仍然表现不佳，突显了加强网络代理基础信息聚合能力的必要性。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的程序化JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成来提高工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序化JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 开发Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成解耦，消除格式约束

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提高18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著提升工具调用性能，对强化学习和监督微调阶段的模型训练都有重要影响，且能扩展缺乏原生支持的模型能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LiRA框架，通过锚定表示组合架构(Arca)和语言耦合语义推理器(LaSR)来提升低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强检索和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言上性能不足的问题，这些语言由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定等原因表现较差。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚点对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca的多语言表示基础上添加语言感知的轻量级推理头，使用一致性正则化统一训练目标。

Result: 在低资源基准测试中（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）显示出持续的性能提升和鲁棒性，在少样本和噪声增强设置下表现稳定。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，为多语言NLP提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重组实体级标记并丢弃大部分其他输入标记，提高seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法高效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 采用压缩表示方法，提取实体级标记并重新组织，同时丢弃大部分其他输入标记，以提高增量处理效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比全前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大量标记是增量共指消解的一种可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新的数据集和分析框架，用于评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性，发现这些模型虽然支持低资源语言，但并未完全满足目标用户需求，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着主权LLMs的发展，缺乏验证这些模型是否与用户社会文化背景对齐、是否保持安全和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥重要作用，但并不总是满足服务目标用户的流行主张，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面和实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在主观质量偏好上的真实能力。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的数据集，涵盖8种创意写作体裁，比较序列奖励模型、零样本语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，零样本语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%。不同写作体裁间模型方差很大，准确率从18.2%到81.8%。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：现有数据缺乏复杂内部模式，且当前方法仅简单提示或微调，缺乏精确思维过程和难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq合成后训练数据集，将数字序列打包为算法问题来发现通项公式；通过反思失败案例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据；使用基于可解性和自生成案例成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的OOD性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过系统化的数据生成和训练方法，有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，同时保持了泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，使用强化学习结合AI反馈来提升语音合成的情绪表达能力，通过ASR和LLM技术分别评估语义准确性和韵律-情绪对齐，在Libri Speech数据集上表现优于Chat-TTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音合成在自然语音方面已接近人类水平，但情绪表达能力仍存在挑战。现有方法依赖昂贵的情绪标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情绪平淡。

Method: 使用强化学习从AI反馈(RLAIF)机制，结合自动语音识别(ASR)和大型语言模型(LLM)技术，分别判断语义准确性和韵律-情绪标签对齐，作为情绪表达性和可理解性优化的直接奖励。通过韵律标签对齐在结构、情绪、速度和音调四个维度增强表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA相比Chat-TTS实现了26.1%的词错误率降低、9.1%的SIM-O提升，以及超过10%的人工评估改进。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架通过直接优化情绪表达性和可理解性，有效提升了语音合成的情绪表达能力，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量的问题

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于相同聚类的文本会共享更多标签的假设

Result: 在四个基准测试集上取得了与现有基线相当或更好的结果，方法简单且计算高效

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在不同模型和数据集上表现稳定

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Method: 提出"nugget-as-rubric"范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；设计基于查询重写的自动rubric构建流程；开发4B参数的Search-Gen-V生成验证器，采用蒸馏思想和两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 提出的"nugget-as-rubric"范式和Search-Gen-V验证器有效解决了搜索增强LLM奖励建模的挑战，为长文本任务在动态语料库中的可验证评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和获取不平等等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解参与。

Method: 开发了一个以人为中心的框架，生成用户故事并支持多代理讨论，帮助人们在部署前创造性思考AI的潜在益处和危害。

Result: 用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，并更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型已从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但仅基于最终答案正确性的强化学习奖励会导致虚假推理，需要过程级监督来改进。

Method: 提出可扩展的自聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提取一致的推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，并联合利用基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过自动生成的过程级监督有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和推理可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个用于评估LLM生成Verilog设计效率的基准测试框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM功能正确性达78.3%，但合成效率仅63-66%，远低于专家实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等合成指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成的硬件设计效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个设计问题，每个问题配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog代码的合成效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在功能正确性方面达到78.3% (pass@1)，但在合成效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0% (eff@1)，显著低于专家实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究进展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，通过逆向工程高质量文本，提供包含逆向提示、详细创作推理和最终文本的三元组。研究发现创意写作需要叙事逻辑（过程监督）和语言表达（通用数据）两个组件，过程监督需要与通用数据稳定结合，创意能力具有文化特异性，词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中，训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督。

Method: 构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种体裁，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本。通过综合实验分析创意写作的两个组件。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：过程监督需要与通用数据稳定结合（最佳比例为1:12）；创意能力具有文化特异性（中英文表现差距89.26%）；词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑框架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，在原始输入输出前添加"Answer:"提示，从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型评估提供了更可靠的结果，是提取规则无关的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在基于大语言模型的检索重排序任务中的效果，发现SFT通过更强的权重机制在LLM重排序中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而大语言模型使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的研究动机。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过统一框架分析CL和SFT的交互作用，并在通用多模态检索(UMR)平台上进行实验比较。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显优势，综合来看SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，并在MRB基准上创造了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: SFT在基于LLM的重排序中优于CL，主要归因于其更强的权重机制，这一发现对未来的研究和应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中常因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，难以应用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；正常生成文本时保持修改后的路由器。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上获得持续性能提升，如HumanEval上OLMoE提升5.5%；与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效改善MoE路由决策，保持计算效率，防止过适应，且与现有测试时扩展技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练能获得更好性能并减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多语言模型在预训练结束时都会加入"中期训练"阶段（混合更高质量、指令格式的数据），但这种做法为何有效缺乏科学理解，需要系统研究其机制和效果。

Method: 通过从头开始预训练语言模型并在不同领域进行监督微调的对照实验，研究了中期训练的效果。特别针对代码领域进行了消融实验，分析了中期训练开始时间和数据混合权重的影响。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距。在代码案例研究中发现，开始时间比混合权重影响更大，较早引入专业数据能获得更好的领域内性能并更好地保持通用语言建模能力。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR构建的新型编译器堆栈，专门针对AMD NPU等细粒度空间架构，通过AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的表示，实现空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步方面存在局限，无法充分利用现代空间架构的性能潜力，需要提供显式机制来协调计算和数据。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言来表示异步和分层操作，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠，无需依赖临时运行时协调或手动调度。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多头部注意力机制仅需约150行代码实现融合，有效映射复杂工作负载到空间硬件。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为空间程序，有效利用NPU的计算结构和内存层次，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在语义等效输入下常产生不一致输出，现有训练数据缺乏一致性关注，且微调技术在提升输出一致性方面存在局限。

Method: 使用系统性合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的层级模型合并方法，整合专业化模型知识。

Result: 合并后的模型显著提升了输出一致性，在响应相似性上相比基线提高了约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业级RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了重要见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提升模型推理性能，还赋予其显著的自奖励能力，从而提升推理时扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过最后一个token自奖励机制高效统一了推理和验证能力，仅需最小额外计算成本即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,

reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化UI轨迹但数据收集成本高昂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化现实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程角度都极其昂贵。

Method: 集成数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，采用引导式展开过程进行连贯探索，并使用轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化轨迹。还提出了UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，通过优先处理高影响力任务和合成信息丰富的轨迹变体来实现更快速和数据高效的缩放。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator与在真实UI上训练的开源代理相当或更优，具有显著更好的鲁棒性。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，能够以更低的成本实现与更大模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时的表现，发现现有模型在方言输入上性能下降32.26%-48.17%，并提出了一种编码器缓解策略来同时提升方言性能并保持标准英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有模型主要基于标准英语训练。

Method: 构建了包含6种常见英语方言的大规模基准数据集，收集了4200多个经过验证的提示，评估了17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计了一种基于编码器的缓解策略来教模型识别新方言特征。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在方言输入上性能下降32.26%-48.17%，传统缓解方法（微调、提示重写）只能小幅改善方言性能（<7%），而作者的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%），且对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能下降，作者提出的编码器缓解策略能有效解决这一问题，在保持标准英语性能的同时大幅提升方言性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了TokDrift框架，通过语义保持的重写规则创建代码变体，发现即使微小的格式变化也会导致代码LLMs行为发生显著变化，揭示了子词分词与语法不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码LLMs使用基于统计的子词分词器（如BPE），而不是基于语法，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因空格或标识符命名等表面因素而被不同地分词，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则生成仅在分词上不同的代码变体，评估九个代码LLMs（包括超过300亿参数的大模型）的行为变化，并进行分层分析。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为发生显著变化，分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不对齐是代码理解和生成可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来的代码LLMs需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应刷新KV缓存来减少扩散大语言模型中的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和层中为所有令牌重新计算QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK令牌可作为长度偏置进行块状缓存；(2) KV动态随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新即可；(3) 最受关注令牌的KV漂移最小。提出训练无关、架构无关的Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定何时刷新（通过最受关注令牌的注意力感知漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（通过深度感知调度）。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现显著加速：GSM8K上8.7倍，长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率，吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，减少了冗余计算，加速了扩散LLM的解码，且生成质量损失可忽略，实现了扩散LLM的实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出DOTechnique方法，通过决策一致性而非输出相似性来确定模型有效性，在缺乏明确有效性边界时也能高效识别有效性区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型有效性对决策过程至关重要，但传统方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，这些框架可能不可用或不充分。

Method: DOTechnique通过评估替代模型是否与高保真模型产生等效决策来确定有效性，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique如何发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持模型有效性的发现。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种融合视觉信息（演讲者图像和演示文稿幻灯片）的多模态自动语音识别方法，在科学演讲场景中显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SOTA ASR系统主要依赖音频信息而忽略多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。特别是在科学演讲场景中，演示文稿幻灯片包含重要的领域特定术语信息。

Method: 创建多模态演讲基准，包括领域特定术语的自动分析；探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；通过数据增强方法解决缺乏配套幻灯片数据集的问题；使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 与基线模型相比，训练后的模型在所有词汇上相对降低了约34%的词错误率，在领域特定术语上相对降低了35%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 集成视觉信息（特别是演示文稿幻灯片）可以显著提升ASR系统在科学演讲场景中的性能，特别是在处理领域特定术语方面效果显著。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中产生因果错觉，这种认知偏见被认为是许多社会问题的基础。

Method: 构建了包含1000个零列联场景的医疗情境数据集，让LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果错觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而没有真正理解因果关系的假设，对在需要准确因果推理的领域使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了一种基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中指导规划。该方法通过图神经网络学习小规模问题的启发式函数，并能够零样本泛化到更大规模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要特定领域的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发统一的图表示框架，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络解码器架构从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后将学习到的启发式函数应用于蒙特卡洛树搜索来指导大规模问题的规划。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了POMDP规划的可扩展泛化，证明了图结构模式从小问题到大问题的可迁移性。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Motivation: 当前前沿AI模型监管面临安全与创新的权衡困境，大多数监管措施因成本问题被搁置。本文旨在寻找既能确保AI安全又能积极促进创新的替代监管方法。

Method: 要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放模拟模型，这些模型是最大专有模型的缩小版本，采用类似训练方法并从大模型中蒸馏得到，作为公开代理供研究社区使用。

Result: 研究表明，基于这些小型模型开发的安全性和可解释性方法能有效泛化到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进步。

Conclusion: 这种强制发布模拟模型的监管方法能以最小额外成本实现公共福利，通过加深对模型的理解来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者的双赢。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，将社会选择理论原则成功应用于文本生成任务

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了有效的安全约束解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产面临气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 改进PerceiverIO架构，采用简化编码器（64D潜在空间）和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性而非冗余。

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法提升显著。

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to

inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在商业视频游戏中应用强化学习（RL）的挑战，提出将RL与行为树（BTs）结合的方法，并通过AMD Schola插件在复杂3D环境中验证了该方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。论文旨在解决游戏AI社区在使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战，并探索RL与传统行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC，并在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中展示联合训练RL模型与行为树的方法论。

Result: 验证了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，展示了在复杂环境中创建多任务NPC的各种技能。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交叉点是一个值得进一步探索的关键节点，尽管在研究中被多次提及，但实际应用仍然罕见。论文证明了这种方法的实际可行性。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个联合嵌入模型，直接从临床对话中检索标准医嘱，无需LLM重写，提供快速、可解释的实时临床医嘱检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定和不透明问题，阻碍实时医嘱处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用双编码器架构，通过对比学习目标对齐异质意图表达，训练时使用受限LLM指导生成互补表述变体。

Result: JEDA在实践中表现优异，大幅超越基础编码器和最新开源嵌入模型，查询无关模式对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床医嘱。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

TL;DR: ARM-FM是一个利用基础模型自动生成奖励机器的强化学习框架，能够从自然语言规范自动构建结构化奖励函数，实现任务分解和零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。传统奖励设计需要专业知识且难以泛化。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器；为每个自动机状态关联语言嵌入以实现任务间泛化；在多样化环境中进行实证验证。

Result: 在多种挑战性环境中证明ARM-FM的有效性，包括零样本泛化能力的证据。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，实现了自动化的组合式奖励设计，解决了强化学习中奖励函数设计的核心挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法以及混合评估框架。实验显示越狱调优使骚扰成功率大幅提升，闭源和开源模型表现出不同的升级轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮互动中，需要开发更贴近现实的评估框架来研究LLM代理的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）以及混合评估方法的综合基准。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash进行实验。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升至99.33%（Gemini）。最常见的毒性行为是侮辱（84.9-87.8%）和谩骂（81.2-85.1%）。闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，需要开发强大的安全护栏来保护在线平台安全。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估深度研究系统时存在不足，无法满足用户中心、动态更新、无歧义和多方面搜索密集型任务的需求。

Method: 构建了包含100个专家策划任务的LiveResearchBench基准，并开发了涵盖内容和报告质量多方面的DeepEval评估套件，集成四种互补评估协议。

Result: 对17个前沿深度研究系统进行了评估，揭示了当前系统的优势、常见失败模式和关键系统组件需求。

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统提供了严格的评估基础，识别了推进可靠深度研究所需的关键组件。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，实现基于LLM的智能体的规模化训练。

Method: 提出ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成奖励模型三个角色，在共享工具环境和LLM骨干网络下形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环强化学习。

Result: ASL实现了稳定轮次性能提升，超越强基线方法，在零标注数据条件下持续改进，表现出优异的样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展自改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Conclusion: MorphoBench提高了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为提升大模型推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间在微调过程中保持安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，导致产生有害响应，需要一种方法来保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器并冻结安全相关组件；构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的影响。

Result: 在多个下游任务上，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，同时将准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架能有效保护大语言模型在微调过程中的安全对齐，在保持安全性的同时提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现三种协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供快速原型设计、评估和防御迭代的工具，展示了框架在模拟攻击场景中的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过系统化方法解决LLM多智能体系统中的安全挑战。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，为多智能体系统提供实时、无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正，通过历史条件异常评分来防止错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱：单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: MASC采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；集成到不同多智能体框架中，在各种架构上带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，MASC框架在多智能体系统中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service展示了主动式AI服务的可行性，为AI从被动工具向主动伴侣的转变提供了有效框架。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time

### [147] [Can MLLMs Absorb Math Reasoning Abilities from LLMs as Free Lunch?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14387)
*Yijie Hu,Zihao Zhou,Kaizhu Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Qiufeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型和数学推理大语言模型中的关键推理参数，将它们投影到多模态模型的子空间中并进行合并，从而直接提升多模态模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型，但直接合并模型参数会因参数空间不对齐而导致性能下降。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别模型中的推理相关参数；2）将数学推理模型的参数投影到多模态模型的子空间；3）在子空间中合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升多模态模型的数学推理能力，且不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging提供了一种无需调优的方法，使多模态大语言模型能够直接从数学推理大语言模型中吸收推理能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在移动设备控制任务中实现了87.9%的最优任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，在新型任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构，将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并设计前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈来指导高层优化。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于基于提示(17.7%)、监督学习(54.5%)和强化学习(71.9%)的方法。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent在移动控制任务中表现出色，能够稳定地进行无评论家的联合训练，并在高复杂度场景中展现出强大的适应性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单个紧凑模型中，显著超越MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准上实现82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中的挑战，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单个模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，训练后的模型达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的结构化推理和规划能力集成到单个小规模模型中，并显著超越原有MAS性能，为复杂推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制与分层公理集在表达能力上是等价的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能针对直接由动作设置的谓词，而非由公理派生的谓词。但文献中作者常偏离这一限制，只要求公理集是分层的。本文旨在证明这两种变体在表达能力上是等价的。

Method: 提出了一种转换方法，通过消除公理中派生谓词的负出现，将分层公理集转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两种公理变体（PDDL标准限制和分层要求）能够表达完全相同的查询，即最小不动点逻辑所表达的查询。

Conclusion: 通过提出的转换方法，可以消除派生谓词的负出现，表明PDDL标准中对负出现的限制并不影响其表达能力，与分层公理集具有相同的表达能力。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

TL;DR: Helmsman是一个多智能体系统，能够从高级用户规范自动合成端到端的联邦学习系统，通过模拟研发工作流程生成与手工设计相媲美甚至更优的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在去中心化数据训练模型方面具有强大潜力，但设计和部署稳健系统的复杂性阻碍了其发展，需要自动化解决方案来克服数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战。

Method: Helmsman采用三阶段协作方法：1)交互式人机循环规划制定研究计划；2)监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3)在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的解决方案与已建立的手工设计基线相比具有竞争力，甚至往往更优。同时引入了AgentFL-Bench基准测试，包含16个多样化任务。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步，Helmsman系统能够有效解决联邦学习系统设计的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

*Emanuele Antonioni,Stefan Markovic,Anirudha Shankar,Jaime Bernardo,Lovro Markovic,Silvia Pareti,Benedetto Proietti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，用于解决大型语言模型使用MCP工具时提示词膨胀的问题。它通过层次化分类和基于查询的工具选择算法，显著减少提示词大小，同时保持甚至提升代理的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望从简单的文本交互转向更复杂的代理系统。MCP等标准使代理能够访问外部工具，但工具数量增加导致提示词膨胀，带来高成本、高延迟和任务成功率下降的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学，使用用户提示来识别和仅包含最相关的工具。该方法基于查询和分类结构进行工具选择。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少了提示词大小，且未显著影响代理的响应能力。在工具数量大幅增加时，JSPLIT甚至提高了工具选择的准确性，在降低成本的同时改善了高复杂度环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示词膨胀问题，通过智能工具选择在降低成本的同时维持或提升代理性能，适用于工具数量不断增长的复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

TL;DR: 本文对神经符号AI中的推理捷径问题进行了系统综述，介绍了其成因、后果、理论特征以及应对方法，旨在降低研究门槛并促进可靠AI的发展。


<details>

Result: 提供了推理捷径的统一视角，系统梳理了其理论特征和应对策略，使研究人员和从业者能够更好地理解和处理这一挑战性问题。

Conclusion: 通过以易于理解的形式重新阐述高级材料，本文旨在为推理捷径提供统一视角，降低研究门槛，最终促进可靠神经符号AI和可信AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM代理是否能够超越智能问题解决工具的角色，成为能够自主规划、设计任务并为模糊目标进行推理的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放环境实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并广泛与环境交互，然后对结果进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能够可靠地遵循复杂多步指令、跨运行存储和重用信息、提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感、容易产生重复任务、无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放环境的潜力和当前限制，为未来训练代理管理记忆、进行有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一种基于图结构的移动代理评估框架，通过模拟真实设备交互的有限状态来实现动态行为的静态仿真，解决了现有评估方法无法全面评估复杂移动任务中多种有效解决方案的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动代理评估标准存在局限性：离线静态基准只能验证单一预定义的"黄金路径"，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可重现性。这两种方法都无法全面评估代理在复杂移动任务中的能力，特别是当任务允许多种有效解决方案时。

Method: 开发了基于图结构的基准框架，通过建模真实设备交互中观察到的有限状态来实现动态行为的静态仿真。在此基础上构建了ColorBench基准，专注于复杂长视野任务，支持多种有效解决方案的评估、子任务完成率统计和原子级能力分析。

Result: ColorBench包含175个任务（74个单应用任务，101个跨应用任务），平均长度超过13步。每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和若干典型错误路径，支持准动态交互。通过在不同基线模型上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以增强代理在复杂长视野问题上的性能。该框架填补了离线和在线评估之间的差距，提高了测试稳定性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别LLMs的局限性，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了系统1认知的规模化运作，但缺乏反思和证伪能力，需要解决这种认知漂移问题。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维诊断框架：地图vs领土（区分现实表征与现实本身）、直觉vs理性（区分快速情感判断与慢速反思思考）、冲突vs确认（区分批判性测试与相互验证强化）。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLMs，而是提供反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理，强调人类或人工直觉必须受人类理性治理，只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器流畅性与人类理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究中对算法偏见的处理情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表的元素，应用于35篇同行评审研究进行系统文献回顾。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架和可操作建议，帮助公共卫生ML从业者持续考虑算法偏见，促进透明度，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非削弱它。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在结构化知识图谱上进行清晰的推理，需要开发能够将自然语言查询转换为可执行推理路径的系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体图检索事实答案和证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到结构化知识图谱推理的转换，支持清晰可逆的威胁-行为-防御推理。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

### [160] [Practical, Utilitarian Algorithm Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14683)
*Devon Graham,Kevin Leyton-Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文改进了COUP算法配置方法，在不影响理论保证的前提下显著提升了其实际性能，使其能够与广泛使用的启发式配置方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COUP算法配置方法虽然具有强大的理论保证，但在实际性能方面关注不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，使基于效用的算法配置方法在实际应用中具有竞争力。

Method: 提出了一系列对COUP算法的改进措施，包括优化其经验性能而不降低理论保证，并通过实验验证这些改进的效果。

Result: 改进后的COUP算法在实证性能上显著提升，能够与广泛使用的启发式配置方法相竞争，同时保持理论性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过系统改进，基于效用的算法配置方法COUP现在具备了实际应用的竞争力，为算法选择问题提供了理论严谨且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

*Bang An,Yibo Yang,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PAVE方法，通过在知识感知子空间中净化任务向量，去除任务无关的冗余信息，提升模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关的冗余信息，导致合并后模型性能显著下降。现有方法随机丢弃参数缺乏知识感知。

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，通过上下文导向的奇异值分解识别知识相关权重分量，将微调模型权重分解为任务相关和冗余组件，并剪枝冗余组件。采用谱秩分配策略优化归一化激活剪枝误差。

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，可应用于各种基于任务向量的合并方法，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余信息，显著提升模型合并性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个认知对齐的时空大语言模型框架，通过自然语言接口整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户信息，用于下一个兴趣点推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和移动模式的理解，且需要整合世界知识和人类认知对齐来提升推荐性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 在脱敏用户时空轨迹数据上继续预训练获取推荐知识；2) 通过监督微调和强化学习实现认知对齐。

Result: 在多个真实数据集和AMAP应用中的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架成功解决了LLMs在POI推荐中的局限性，通过认知对齐提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在函数调用等结构化输出任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在函数调用等结构化输出领域的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建首个细粒度调用内过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则：由于结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复特性，需要"多探索但少保留"。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SimKO方法来解决强化学习可验证奖励(RLVR)中的过度集中问题，通过不对称地调整正确和错误回答的概率分布来改善探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K(K>1)下降。研究发现这是由于词汇候选的概率过度集中在top-1候选项上。

Method: 提出SimKO方法：对于验证正确的回答，提升top-K候选项的概率；对于验证错误的回答，对top-1候选项施加更强的惩罚。该方法特别适用于高熵token。

Result: 在多个数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO一致地提高了各种K值的pass@K性能，有效改善了RLVR的探索能力。

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题，为改进RLVR的探索提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性获取必要元信息，显著减少NL2SQL任务中的token使用量，降低成本的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token消耗大、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理系统设计，使用交互式循环和推理框架，让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表问答任务，而非一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表问答任务上的评估显示，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，同时保持有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过选择性信息获取策略，有效解决了NL2SQL任务中元信息过多导致的成本问题，实现了显著的成本节约。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: 提出RoboGPT-R1两阶段微调框架，通过监督学习获取基础知识，再通过强化学习提升视觉空间理解和推理能力，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著超越GPT-4o-mini和其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂真实环境中执行长视野操作任务时，由于常识和推理能力受限而面临的挑战。

Method: 两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足，设计基于规则的奖励函数考虑长期性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型在EmbodiedBench基准上比GPT-4o-mini高出21.33%，比基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的其他工作高出20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架有效提升了具身智能体的推理能力，在长视野操作任务中表现出色，证明了强化学习在弥补监督学习不足方面的重要性。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率来增强可靠性，在包含2-10条指令的情况下可将遵循率提升4-7个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 提出了Instruction Boosting后生成方法，并创建了SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10条指令的数据样本，还开发了定量冲突评分工具来分析指令间的冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，对2条指令提升7个百分点，对10条指令提升4个百分点。分析发现性能下降与指令间冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting有效提高LLM指令遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具能为开发者提供关于额外指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，约束在固定安全包络内；通过单次连续参数加权所有可达路径，求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供搜索图的几何解释和多数投票实例化验证。

Result: 建立了衡量智能体及其搜索空间的工作语言和操作工具，为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统化的形式化描述。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM辅助的迭代搜索提供了形式化框架，能够系统描述和测量基于领域先验指导的搜索过程。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过低保真潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文的方法，解决LLM代理在复杂知识系统中面临的上下文窗口限制和状态同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测和资源使用效率低下，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，要求代理先在低保真潜在状态表示上操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行，作为声明式状态同步协议。

Result: 在软件开发的Sage参考实现中，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和接地气的AI代理提供了基础方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标注数据或模型权重更新的强化学习代理，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，迭代改进企业智能平台中的模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自多个第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式差或不完整，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 使用强化学习代理，在推理过程中：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代后)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Conclusion: 对于实际应用，基于判别式验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是自一致性的"免费"升级，也是比昂贵生成技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断推理系统的过度自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: H-Risk能预测过度自信错误；LLMs中脆弱内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关；批判式提示对校准和幻觉效果不一。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，仅用10%的数据量就在ProcessBench上实现26%的相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标不一致。传统方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估或存在信用分配问题的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径以减少奖励噪声；2) 通过外部工具验证中间步骤消除幻觉监督；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅用4万自动标注样本（最佳PRM的10%数据量），在ProcessBench上实现高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，能够实现高质量的过程级推理，解决了现有PRM方法的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.
