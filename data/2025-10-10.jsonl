L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four.

We revisit this problem and show\nthat widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model\ncapability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better\nexploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both\ncontrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art.

As\nthe core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down\ncommunication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service\ndiscovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless\ninterconnection and interoperability of the underlying network.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods."}

However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in\nLLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features.

To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we\npropose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that\nformulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL\njointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is\nincentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and\nhelpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a\nDynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the\nconversation agent incorporates the feedback.

Lightweight models like BERT handle\nexplicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models\n(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,\nwe propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and\nrobustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves\nhigh-confidence explicit cases.

To validate and exploit this\ninsight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification\nframework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the\nrelationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV\nproduces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally\nidentifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors.

Models can match memorized content rather\nthan demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts\ncross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,\na model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test\ncases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse\npool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each\ntest case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original\nobjective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and\naggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose\nshared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations\nthat steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply\nArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains\nand show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new\nfailure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,\nand improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to\ncontinuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation\nmodels."}
