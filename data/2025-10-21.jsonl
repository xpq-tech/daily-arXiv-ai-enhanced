This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a\nstatistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of\nsource-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their\ninteraction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by\nmanipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level\nby varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled\nexperiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays\nin-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)\nfactual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

However, existing unlearning\napproaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model\nutility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated\nresponses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves\nperformance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,\nachieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC\nbenchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning\neffectiveness.

We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models\nacross diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%\nreduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised\ntraining and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,\nthe model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting \"I don't know\"\nwhen faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%\nfewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these\nfactuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,\nmath, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,\ninduces quality regressions."}

The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets.

To tackle high-complexity data science\ntasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates\nthe learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to\nprogressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world\nenvironments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework\nthat constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,\nDeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data\nquestion answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data\nresearch. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze\noutperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary\nLLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,\npaving the way toward autonomous data science."}

To address this question, we\narchitecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via\nreinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into\nState Estimation (\"what is the current state?\") and Transition Modeling (\"what\ncomes next?\") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning\nstrategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs\nreveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language\nexcels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured\nformats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on\nthese insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,\nturn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level\nGeneral Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.\nThrough this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a\nscore of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\\times$\nimprovement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary\nreasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5\n(0.62).
