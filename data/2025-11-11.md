<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型在理解和生成任务上存在表征冲突，阻碍了基于指令的自由形式语音编辑能力的发展。

Method: 开发了统一的连续语音分词器MingTok-Audio整合语义和声学特征，并基于此构建语音语言模型Ming-UniAudio及其编辑版本Ming-UniAudio-Edit。

Result: 在ContextASR基准测试中，8/12指标达到SOTA；中文语音克隆Seed-TTS-WER为0.95；建立了首个自由形式语音编辑基准Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit。

Conclusion: 该框架成功统一了语音理解、生成和编辑能力，为统一音频处理奠定了基础，相关模型已开源。

Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.

*Myeongseob Ko,Nikhil Reddy Billa,Adam Nguyen,Charles Fleming,Ming Jin,Ruoxi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了混淆诱导攻击(CIA)框架，通过系统性地最大化模型不确定性来提取记忆的训练数据，在未对齐和对齐的LLMs上都优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练数据记忆化带来了严重的隐私和版权问题，现有的数据提取方法成功率有限且对记忆化泄漏的根本驱动因素洞察不足。

Method: 提出混淆诱导攻击(CIA)框架，通过优化输入片段刻意诱导连续高熵状态；针对对齐LLMs提出不匹配监督微调(Mismatched SFT)来同时削弱对齐性并诱导目标混淆。

Result: 实验表明CIA攻击在提取逐字和近似逐字训练数据方面优于现有基线方法，且不需要训练数据的先验知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了各种LLMs中持续存在的记忆化风险，并提供了更系统化的方法来评估这些漏洞。

Abstract: The memorization of training data in large language models (LLMs) poses significant privacy and copyright concerns. Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.

### [3] [Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Personalized Harmful Content Detection with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05532)
*Rufan Zhang,Lin Zhang,Xianghang Mi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于上下文学习的基础模型框架，统一检测有害内容，支持轻量级个性化定制而无需重新训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核系统存在中心化、任务特定、透明度低、忽视用户偏好等问题，不适用于隐私敏感或去中心化环境

Method: 利用基础模型的上下文学习能力，通过提示工程实现毒性、垃圾信息和负面情感的统一检测，支持用户通过简单提示干预进行个性化定制

Result: 在公开基准和新标注的Mastodon数据集上验证：基础模型实现强跨任务泛化能力，个性化仅需1个用户示例，增强提示显著提升鲁棒性

Conclusion: 展示了超越通用审核的转变，确立上下文学习作为实用、隐私保护且高度适应性的用户中心内容安全系统新途径

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful online content--e.g., toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment--demands robust and adaptable moderation systems. However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face.

Motivation: 将生成式AI引入建筑、工程和施工领域，需要能够将自然语言指令转换为标准化数据模型操作的系统。

Method: 提供BIM工具集，包括场景查询工具、预定义函数用于创建和修改建筑元素，以及结合上下文学习和检索增强生成的动态代码生成系统。

Conclusion: 该框架作为开源发布，旨在促进LLM驱动的BIM设计研究，并为AI辅助建模工作流提供基础。

Abstract: Bringing generative AI into the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) field requires systems that can translate natural language instructions into actions on standardized data models. We present MCP4IFC, a comprehensive open-source framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly manipulate Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The framework provides a set of BIM tools, including scene querying tools for information retrieval, predefined functions for creating and modifying common building elements, and a dynamic code-generation system that combines in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle tasks beyond the predefined toolset. Experiments demonstrate that an LLM using our framework can successfully perform complex tasks, from building a simple house to querying and editing existing IFC data. Our framework is released as open-source to encourage research in LLM-driven BIM design and provide a foundation for AI-assisted modeling workflows. Our code is available at https://show2instruct.github.io/mcp4ifc/.

### [5] [FlowMM: Cross-Modal Information Flow Guided KV Cache Merging for Efficient Multimodal Context Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05534)
*Kunxi Li,Yufan Xiong,Zhonghua Jiang,Yiyun Zhou,Zhaode Wang,Chengfei Lv,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlowMM是一个基于跨模态信息流的多模态KV缓存合并框架，通过层特定合并策略和敏感度自适应令牌匹配，在减少80-95% KV缓存内存和1.3-1.8倍解码延迟的同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰策略会降低生成质量，而现有的KV合并方法在多模态场景中因模态令牌分布偏差和跨模态注意力偏差而效果受限。

Method: 利用跨模态信息流动态应用层特定合并策略，引入敏感度自适应令牌匹配机制，联合评估令牌相似性和任务关键敏感度。

Result: 在多种领先MLLMs上的实验显示，FlowMM减少80-95% KV缓存内存和1.3-1.8倍解码延迟，同时保持竞争力的任务性能。

Conclusion: FlowMM通过跨模态信息流指导的多模态KV缓存合并，有效解决了多模态场景中的缓存效率问题，在显著提升效率的同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV-pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, causing context loss or hallucinations. Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.

### [6] [Future of AI Models: A Computational perspective on Model collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05535)
*Trivikram Satharasi,S Sitharama Iyengar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析2013-2025年英文维基百科的语义相似度，量化了AI生成内容递归训练导致模型崩溃的风险。结果显示在LLM公开采用后，语义相似度呈指数级增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容在网络上快速扩张（已占新网页的74.2%和活跃网络语料的30-40%），递归训练可能导致语言和语义多样性退化，引发模型崩溃问题。

Method: 使用Transformer嵌入和余弦相似度度量，分析2013-2025年英文维基百科（过滤自Common Crawl）的逐年语义相似度变化。

Result: 在LLM公开采用前语义相似度稳步上升（受早期RNN/LSTM翻译和文本规范化影响），LLM采用后相似度呈指数级增长，但仍有不可约的语言多样性波动。

Conclusion: 研究提供了数据驱动的估计，表明递归AI污染何时可能显著威胁数据丰富性和模型泛化能力，为防范模型崩溃提供了量化依据。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.

### [7] [Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05541)
*Usha Bhalla,Alex Oesterling,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio P. Calmon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs)，通过引入对比损失来鼓励相邻token间特征激活的一致性，从而更好地分离语义和句法特征，解决传统稀疏自编码器在捕捉语言概念时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器在发现可解释特征时存在偏见，倾向于捕捉浅层、token特定或嘈杂的特征，而忽略了语言丰富的概念信息。这源于训练方法未能利用语言本身的结构知识。

Method: 基于语言中语义内容具有长程依赖性和序列平滑性，而句法信息更局部的洞察，提出T-SAEs，引入新颖的对比损失来鼓励相邻token间高级特征激活的一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，T-SAEs能够恢复更平滑、更连贯的语义概念，且不牺牲重建质量。尽管没有明确的语义信号训练，仍展现出清晰的语义结构。

Conclusion: T-SAEs为语言模型的无监督可解释性提供了新途径，能够以自监督方式有效分离语义和句法特征。

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

### [8] [UTF-8 Plumbing: Byte-level Tokenizers Unavoidably Enable LLMs to Generate Ill-formed UTF-8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05578)
*Preston Firestone,Shubham Ugare,Gagandeep Singh,Sasa Misailovic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从数学角度证明，使用包含无效UTF-8字符的子词分词器会产生无效UTF-8序列，导致现实中的程序错误，并评估了相关缓解措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型使用字节级分词可避免词汇表外错误，但会产生无效UTF-8序列，破坏依赖UTF-8输入的代码，需要系统性地解决这一问题。

Method: 使用幺半群理论形式化分词过程，证明包含无效UTF-8词汇表的分词器必然产生无效序列，并分析增量解码与批量解码的差异。

Result: 理论预测得到现实验证：评估了主流基础模型、服务引擎和受限生成系统中的相关错误，并测试了多种缓解方案。

Conclusion: 字节级分词虽然解决了词汇表外问题，但引入了UTF-8有效性挑战，需要模型开发者和应用开发者共同关注和解决。

Abstract: Subword tokenization segments input text according to a pre-defined vocabulary to feed it into a language model; the language model, in turn, generates a sequence made from this same vocabulary. The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems.

### [9] [Optimizing Diversity and Quality through Base-Aligned Model Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05650)
*Yichen Wang,Chenghao Yang,Tenghao Huang,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Mina Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BACo是一个推理时令牌级模型协作框架，通过动态结合基础LLM和对齐LLM来优化输出的多样性和质量，在单次推理中实现21.3%的多样性和质量联合提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐虽然提高了大语言模型的输出质量，但牺牲了多样性，导致生成内容高度相似。现有方法如重新训练、提示工程和多采样方法要么降低质量，要么需要昂贵的解码或后训练成本。

Method: 采用基础模型与对齐模型的协作框架，基于下一个令牌预测不确定性和预测内容的语义角色，在每个令牌级别动态决定从哪个模型解码。

Result: 在三个开放生成任务和13个评估指标上，BACo持续超越最先进的推理时基线方法，最佳路由器实现了21.3%的多样性和质量联合提升，人类评估也证实了这些改进。

Conclusion: 基础模型和对齐模型之间的协作可以有效优化和控制输出的多样性和质量，提供强大的可控性。

Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and the Gemini series have improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as "free" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hapax方法通过抑制归纳复制来训练Transformer模型，发现即使减少归纳复制，模型在抽象性上下文学习任务上的表现仍保持相当甚至更好，表明归纳复制并非抽象性上下文学习能力的必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当抑制归纳复制时，Transformer模型是否仍能获得上下文学习能力，以验证归纳复制是否是复杂上下文学习能力的先决条件。

Method: 提出Hapax设置，在训练中省略能被归纳头正确预测的token的损失贡献，从而抑制归纳复制行为。

Result: 尽管31.7%的token被从损失中省略，模型在21个任务中的13个上表现优于基线模型，且在归纳头无法正确预测的位置上损失值更低。

Conclusion: 归纳复制对于学习抽象性上下文学习机制并非必需，模型可以通过其他机制获得上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Induction heads are attention heads that perform inductive copying by matching patterns from earlier context and copying their continuations verbatim. As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本分类中复杂语义上下文的建模问题，需要平衡全局与局部信息、语义与结构的关系，提供更全面的特征表示。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) 大语言模型提取深度语义特征；2) 特征金字塔机制融合多尺度特征；3) 图神经网络建模语义关系和逻辑依赖。

Result: 在鲁棒性对齐实验中，该方法在ACC、F1-Score、AUC和Precision等指标上均优于现有模型，验证了框架的有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究构建了一个平衡全局与局部信息、语义与结构的集成框架，为文本分类任务中的多尺度特征融合和结构化语义建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: This study investigates a hybrid method for text classification that integrates deep feature extraction from large language models, multi-scale fusion through feature pyramids, and structured modeling with graph neural networks to enhance performance in complex semantic contexts. First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了语言生成的理论可能性与实际可行性之间存在巨大差距，即使对于简单的正则语言和上下文无关语言，成功生成所需的样本数量可能极其庞大甚至不可计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Kleinberg和Mullainathan证明了语言生成在理论上是可能的，但这种理论保证并未解决其实际可行性问题。本文旨在探讨语言生成在实际中的效率限制。

Method: 通过分析简单且经过充分研究的语言家族（如正则语言和上下文无关语言），研究成功生成所需的最小样本数量。

Result: 研究发现，即使是简单的语言家族，成功生成所需的样本数量可能极其庞大，在某些情况下甚至不受任何可计算函数的限制。

Conclusion: 理论可能性与高效可学习性之间存在实质性差距，解释现代语言模型的经验成功需要考虑到自然语言的结构特性，这些特性使得有效生成在实践中成为可能。

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan showed that, in principle, language generation is always possible: with sufficiently many positive examples, a learner can eventually produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a target language. However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

TL;DR: DRAGON是一个基于推理的框架，通过上下文思维链指令在LLM推理前进行防护，无需修改基础模型或保留数据，在数据受限场景下实现有效的知识遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法通常需要训练或访问保留数据，这在现实场景中往往不可得，因此需要开发在数据受限情况下仍能有效工作的遗忘方法。

Method: 提出DRAGON框架，利用LLM固有的指令遵循能力，引入轻量级检测模块识别需要遗忘的提示，然后通过专用的CoT防护模型进行安全准确的上文干预。

Result: 在三个代表性遗忘任务上的广泛实验验证了DRAGON的有效性，展示了其强大的遗忘能力、可扩展性和在实际场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: DRAGON提供了一种系统性的、基于推理的方法，能够在没有保留数据的情况下实现有效的LLM知识遗忘，为实际应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

### [15] [Quantifying Edits Decay in Fine-tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05852)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识编辑后微调对编辑效果的影响，发现编辑会在微调后衰减，不同配置下衰减程度不同，并提出选择性层微调策略来有效移除编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究知识编辑和微调两种后训练干预方法的交互作用，解决两个实际问题：移除隐蔽或恶意编辑，以及保护有益编辑。如果微调会损害编辑效果，当前的知识编辑方法实用性将降低；如果编辑持续存在，微调模型可能传播恶意编辑，带来安全隐患。

Method: 系统量化微调后编辑的衰减情况，评估两种最先进的编辑方法（MEMIT、AlphaEdit）和三种微调方法（全参数、LoRA、DoRA），涵盖五个LLM和三个数据集，共232个实验配置。提出选择性层微调策略。

Result: 编辑在微调后会衰减，不同配置下生存率不同，AlphaEdit编辑比MEMIT编辑衰减更多。选择性层微调（仅微调编辑层）能有效移除编辑，但会轻微影响下游性能。令人惊讶的是，仅微调非编辑层比全微调对编辑的损害更大。

Conclusion: 本研究为知识编辑与微调的整合建立了经验基准和可行策略，强调评估模型编辑需要考虑完整的LLM应用流程。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

Motivation: 医学知识的快速增长和临床实践的复杂性给医疗AI应用带来挑战，LLMs虽有价值但存在固有局限，RAG技术有望增强其临床应用能力。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，分析医学RAG应用的研究现状，包括数据来源、检索方法、LLM类型和评估方式。

Result: 研究发现医学RAG主要依赖公开数据，检索使用英语嵌入模型，LLM多为通用模型，评估侧重生成质量和任务性能，应用集中在问答、报告生成、文本摘要和信息抽取。

Conclusion: 医学RAG仍处于早期阶段，需要在临床验证、跨语言适应和低资源环境支持方面取得进展，以实现可信赖和负责任的全球应用。

Abstract: The rapid growth of medical knowledge and increasing complexity of clinical practice pose challenges. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.

TL;DR: NILC是一个专为新意图发现设计的迭代聚类框架，利用大语言模型增强聚类质心和重写困难样本，在无监督和半监督设置下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NID方法采用级联架构，无法利用两个阶段的反馈进行相互优化，且仅基于嵌入的聚类忽略了细微的文本语义，导致性能不佳。

Method: NILC采用迭代工作流程，利用LLMs创建语义质心丰富嵌入质心的上下文语义，重写困难样本进行聚类校正，并在半监督设置中注入监督信号。

Result: 在六个不同领域的基准数据集上，NILC在无监督和半监督设置下均显著优于多个最新基线方法。

Conclusion: NILC通过LLMs增强语义理解和迭代优化，为新意图发现提供了有效的解决方案，在多个数据集上展现了优越性能。

Abstract: New intent discovery (NID) seeks to recognize both new and known intents from unlabeled user utterances, which finds prevalent use in practical dialogue systems. Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，IDALC比基线方法准确率提高5-10%，宏F1提高4-8%，仅需6-10%的未标注数据进行标注。

Conclusion: IDALC框架能有效检测用户意图并修正系统拒绝的话语，显著减少人工标注需求，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低标注成本。

Abstract: Voice-controlled dialog systems have become immensely popular due to their ability to perform a wide range of actions in response to diverse user queries. These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1

*Renfei Zhang,Manasa Kaniselvan,Niloofar Mireshghallah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）实际上能提升语言模型在知识回忆任务中的表现，特别是在需要遍历层次化结构化知识（如医疗代码）的任务上，这挑战了RL会损害记忆知识的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即强化学习会损害语言模型的记忆知识，并探索RL如何通过改进知识遍历和搜索程序技能来提升知识回忆性能。

Method: 使用结构化提示引导SFT模型进行层次遍历，比较SFT和RL模型在知识回忆任务上的表现，并进行层间内部激活分析。

Result: RL增强模型在知识回忆任务上始终优于基础模型和SFT模型；结构化提示能显著缩小性能差距（在MedConceptsQA上将24pp降至7pp）；RL模型在深度检索任务中保持更好的程序路径回忆能力；内部激活分析显示RL主要改变知识遍历方式而非知识表示本身。

Conclusion: 强化学习主要通过改进知识遍历和搜索的程序技能来提升语言模型的性能，而不是改变知识表示本身，这为RL在知识密集型任务中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中LLM的熵通常会崩溃，导致过早收敛到次优局部最小值并阻碍性能提升，但缺乏对RLVR中熵的全面研究。

Method: 通过大量实验研究RLVR训练中LLM的熵动态，分析模型熵与响应多样性、校准和性能的关联，并理论证明正优势token是熵崩溃的主要贡献者。

Result: 发现离策略更新次数、训练数据多样性和优化目标中的裁剪阈值是影响RLVR训练中LLM熵的关键因素。

Conclusion: 模型熵可以通过在训练期间调整正负优势token的相对损失权重来有效调控，为解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

Motivation: 临床干预通常依赖年龄信息，但语言模型在生物医学证据合成中是否保留关键的人口统计学区别尚不确定。

Method: 构建DemogSummary数据集，评估Qwen、Longformer和GPT-4.1 Nano三个模型，使用标准指标和新提出的Demographic Salience Score（DSS）量化年龄相关实体保留和幻觉。

Result: 模型和年龄组之间存在系统性差异：成人群体摘要的人口统计学保真度最低，弱势群体更容易出现幻觉。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在忠实和无偏见的摘要生成方面存在局限性，需要在生物医学NLP中开发公平感知的评估框架和摘要流程。

Abstract: Clinical interventions often hinge on age: medications and procedures safe for adults may be harmful to children or ineffective for older adults. However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐技术如RLHF和DPO在解决文化特定和多维度歧视方面存在局限，需要更有效的去偏见方法。

Method: 构建基于中文语境歧视类别的合成数据集，训练基于DeBERTa-v3的多维度奖励模型，然后使用GRPO框架进行微调优化。

Result: 实验结果显示偏见强度显著降低，模型在保持流畅性和信息量的同时更好地符合非歧视标准。

Conclusion: GRPO多奖励优化方法在去偏见方面有效，为文化语境伦理对齐提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit implicit biases and discriminatory tendencies that reflect underlying social stereotypes. While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness. This study highlights the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs and offers a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment.

Result: 该混合方法使用户能够通过有针对性的、可解释的特征子集来研究稀疏自编码器行为。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了潜在空间中概念表示的更深入、更细致分析，解决了大规模特征探索的挑战。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) through the sparse directions they learn. However, the sheer number of extracted directions makes comprehensive exploration intractable. While conventional embedding techniques such as UMAP can reveal global structure, they suffer from limitations including high-dimensional compression artifacts, overplotting, and misleading neighborhood distortions. In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.

Compared to traditional BERT-based approaches with similar computational requirements, our method demonstrates superior performance through strategic dataset unification and optimized fine-tuning. The system requires only 1.87M trainable parameters (1.37% of full fine-tuning) and trains in approximately 2 hours on a single T4 GPU, making robust hate speech detection accessible in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: ReMoD通过双推理范式有效解决了多模态立场检测中的模态贡献不平衡问题，实现了更鲁棒和上下文感知的立场决策。

Abstract: Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The reproduction of hardware architectures from academic papers remains a significant challenge due to the lack of publicly available source code and the complexity of hardware description languages (HDLs). To this end, we propose \textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion. Furthermore, evaluation and physical implementation of the generated executable RTL code show that these implementations meet all timing constraints without violations, and their performance metrics are consistent with those reported in the original papers.

Conclusion: Licensing Oracle为基于结构化知识的领域提供了统计方法无法匹配的幻觉消除保证

Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

TL;DR: RAG方法在信息分散或需要复杂推理的问题上表现不佳，但通过结合结构化输出格式和答案验证，可以显著优于长上下文方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法在处理信息分散在多个文档或需要复杂推理的问题时存在局限，LOFT研究显示长上下文语言模型也有类似问题，QUEST基准测试表现不佳。

Method: 优化RAG方法，结合包含推理和证据的结构化输出格式，并可选地进行答案重新验证。

Result: 经过深入分析和人工评估，优化后的RAG方法在QUEST-LOFT基准上显著优于长上下文方法。

Conclusion: RAG方法可以通过结构化输出和验证机制来克服信息分散和复杂推理的挑战，在特定场景下优于长上下文方法。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a solution for grounded QA in both academia and industry, current RAG methods struggle with questions where the necessary information is distributed across many documents or where retrieval needs to be combined with complex reasoning. Recently, the LOFT study has shown that this limitation also applies to approaches based on long-context language models, with the QUEST benchmark exhibiting particularly large headroom. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the poor performance on QUEST-LOFT, publish updated numbers based on a thorough human evaluation, and demonstrate that RAG can be optimized to significantly outperform long-context approaches when combined with a structured output format containing reasoning and evidence, optionally followed by answer re-verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用指代表达理解任务来评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，分析了模型在物体检测模糊、复杂空间关系和否定表达等挑战下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间推理是人类认知的重要组成部分，但现有视觉语言模型在这方面存在困难。当前分析工作主要使用图像描述和视觉问答任务，需要更深入评估空间理解能力。

Method: 采用指代表达理解任务作为评估平台，分析模型在三种挑战情况下的表现：1）物体检测模糊；2）复杂空间关系和长句结构；3）否定表达。使用任务特定架构和大型视觉语言模型进行对比分析。

Result: 所有模型在处理这些挑战时都面临困难，但相对表现取决于底层模型和具体空间语义类别（拓扑、方向、邻近等）。不同模型在不同场景下表现出不同的优势和弱点。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的挑战和特定行为模式，为未来研究方向提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面向特定方面的书籍摘要评估难题，因为长文本难以构建参考摘要。

Method: 基于叙事知识图谱自动生成面向特定方面的QA对，通过摘要的问答性能来评估其质量。

Result: 实验显示LLM方法在短文本上准确率更高，但随着文档长度增加，RAG方法变得更为有效和实用。

Conclusion: RAG方法在面向特定方面的长文档摘要任务中比LLM方法更高效实用。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries that highlight specific aspects of a text, enabling more personalized and targeted summaries. However, its application to books remains unexplored due to the difficulty of constructing reference summaries for long text. To address this challenge, we propose BookAsSumQA, a QA-based evaluation framework for aspect-based book summarization. BookAsSumQA automatically generates aspect-specific QA pairs from a narrative knowledge graph to evaluate summary quality based on its question-answering performance. Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.

TL;DR: STEER是一个无需外部模型的细粒度路由框架，通过小模型置信度分数在推理步骤级别动态路由到大模型，在降低推理成本的同时保持或提升推理精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法需要训练外部路由模型，缺乏领域鲁棒性且需要昂贵的标注数据。本文旨在开发无需外部模型、领域无关的细粒度路由方案来降低LLM推理成本。

Method: 提出STEER框架，利用小模型在生成推理步骤前的置信度分数作为路由信号，仅在必要时调用大模型，实现步骤级别的动态路由。

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和规划任务等多个领域基准测试中，STEER在减少推理成本的同时达到竞争性或更高的准确率（相比仅用大模型，在AIME上准确率提升20%，FLOPs减少48%）。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是鲁棒、领域无关的路由信号，为高效LLM部署提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) - particularly model scaling and test-time techniques - have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of language models at the expense of higher inference costs. To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules. Our results establish model-internal confidence as a robust, domain-agnostic signal for model routing, offering a scalable pathway for efficient LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在阿尔茨海默病检测中面临的任务识别失败、演示选择不佳和标签词与任务目标不对齐等问题，特别是在分布外和数据稀缺的临床领域。

Method: EK-ICL框架整合三个知识组件：基于小语言模型的置信度分数、解析特征分数和标签词替换，同时采用基于解析的检索策略和集成预测。

Result: 在三个AD数据集上的实验表明，EK-ICL显著优于最先进的微调和ICL基线方法。

Conclusion: ICL在AD检测中的性能对标签语义和任务特定上下文的对齐高度敏感，凸显了在低资源临床推理中显性知识的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from narrative transcripts remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) and data-scarce conditions. While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.

*Yue Huang,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPA是一种无监督的优先级对齐框架，通过自生成、自评估和双重标准去噪，在保持可信度的前提下提升LLM的有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景中，LLM需要同时具备可信度和有用性，但这两个目标常常冲突。需要一种能够强制执行"可信优先于有用"排序的对齐方法。

Method: 提出自我优先级对齐(SPA)框架：生成多样化响应、自评估和自优化、应用双重标准去噪，构建词典序偏好对，使用不确定性加权的对齐损失进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPA在不损害安全性的情况下提高了有用性，优于强基线方法，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: SPA为关键LLM应用提供了一种可扩展且可解释的对齐策略，能够有效平衡可信度和有用性之间的权衡。

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios-such as self-harm, legal, or medical queries-LLMs must be both trustworthy and helpful. However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict "trustworthy-before-helpful" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.

Abstract: Discharge medication recommendation plays a critical role in ensuring treatment continuity, preventing readmission, and improving long-term management for patients with chronic metabolic diseases. This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs.

TL;DR: ELECTRA-small模型在SNLI数据集上微调后，在处理包含否定的语句时表现不佳。通过添加强调否定的对比集和对抗样本进行数据增强，提高了模型对否定语句的分类准确性，且不影响整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在自然语言推理任务中往往通过利用虚假相关性而非真正理解语言结构（如否定）来获得高基准性能，这暴露了数据集伪影问题。

Method: 对ELECTRA-small模型在SNLI数据集上进行微调，分析其处理否定语句的表现，并通过添加强调否定的对比集和对抗样本来增强训练数据。

Result: 目标数据增强显著提高了模型对包含否定语句的分类准确性，同时没有对整体性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 针对性的数据增强是缓解数据集伪影问题的有效方法，能够改善模型对特定语言结构（如否定）的理解能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained models for natural language inference (NLI) often achieve high performance on benchmark datasets by using spurious correlations, or dataset artifacts, rather than understanding language touches such as negation. In this project, we investigate the performance of an ELECTRA-small model fine-tuned on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, focusing on its handling of negation. Through analysis, we identify that the model struggles with correctly classifying examples containing negation. To address this, we augment the training data with contrast sets and adversarial examples emphasizing negation. Our results demonstrate that this targeted data augmentation improves the model's accuracy on negation-containing examples without adversely affecting overall performance, therefore mitigating the identified dataset artifact.

Conclusion: TimeSense通过平衡文本推理与时间感知，有效提升了LLMs在时间序列分析中的能力，解决了现有方法的文本偏见问题。

Abstract: In the time-series domain, an increasing number of works combine text with temporal data to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for various downstream time-series understanding tasks. This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了HatePrototypes方法，通过从优化过的语言模型中提取类别级向量表示，实现显性和隐性仇恨言论检测的跨任务迁移，无需重复微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测基准主要关注针对受保护群体的显性仇恨，而忽略了隐性或间接仇恨（如贬低性比较、排斥或暴力呼吁、微妙歧视语言等），这些同样会造成伤害。显性仇恨可以通过表面特征捕获，但隐性仇恨需要更深层的语义处理。

Method: 使用HatePrototypes方法，从优化用于仇恨言论检测和安全审核的语言模型中提取类别级向量表示。这些原型仅需每类50个示例构建，支持显性和隐性仇恨之间的跨任务迁移，并实现参数无关的早期退出机制。

Result: 研究发现这些原型能够在显性和隐性仇恨检测任务之间实现跨任务迁移，原型在不同基准之间可互换使用。参数无关的早期退出机制对两种仇恨类型都有效。

Conclusion: HatePrototypes方法为高效且可迁移的仇恨言论检测提供了新途径，避免了重复微调的需求，支持跨不同类型仇恨言论的检测能力。

Abstract: Optimization of offensive content moderation models for different types of hateful messages is typically achieved through continued pre-training or fine-tuning on new hate speech benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types. We release the code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection.

Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在药物开发和个性化医疗领域的实际应用能力，特别是对药物作用机制的事实知识掌握和在新颖情境下的推理能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含已知药物机制事实知识和反事实推理任务的数据集，评估模型在开放世界和封闭世界设置下的表现。

Result: o4-mini模型表现最佳，Qwen3-4B-thinking模型在某些情况下超越o4-mini；开放世界设置比封闭世界更具挑战性；影响推理链内部环节的反事实任务比影响药物环节的任务更难。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物机制推理方面展现出潜力，但开放世界设置和复杂反事实推理仍是挑战；小型模型如Qwen3-4B-thinking在某些任务上可媲美大型模型。

Abstract: Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.

Abstract: Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/HealthQuote.NL

Abstract: As AI moves beyond text, large language models (LLMs) increasingly power vision, audio, and document understanding; however, their high inference costs hinder real-time, scalable deployment. Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

*Bohan Yu,Wei Huang,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SR-KI是一种将大规模结构化知识库集成到LLM中的新方法，通过编码知识库为键值对并注入KV缓存，采用两阶段训练实现端到端推理，支持动态知识更新和高效知识压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成方法依赖外部检索器和多阶段流水线，性能受限且效率低。需要一种能在模型潜在空间内完成检索、支持端到端推理和动态知识更新的方法。

Method: 1) 使用预训练编码器将知识库编码为键值对并注入LLM的KV缓存；2) 两阶段训练：定位专用检索层，在该层应用基于注意力的损失函数监督对相关知识条目的关注；3) 完全在模型潜在空间内执行检索。

Result: 在单张A100 40GB GPU上成功集成40K知识库到7B LLM，检索性能强劲：最佳任务Recall@10超过98%，所有任务平均超过88%。问答和知识库ID生成任务表现良好，同时实现高达99.75%的知识库压缩。

Conclusion: SR-KI提供了一种高效集成大规模结构化知识库到LLM的解决方案，支持端到端推理、动态知识更新和显著的知识压缩，在保持强性能的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes SR-KI, a novel approach for integrating real-time and large-scale structured knowledge bases (KBs) into large language models (LLMs). SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs.

TL;DR: 研究表明，对于多语言模型中的跨语言迁移，使用精心选择的语言子集进行词对齐可以匹配甚至优于全语言对齐，特别是在低资源语言上表现更佳，这减少了数据收集开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词对齐是改善多语言模型跨语言迁移的有效策略，但现有方法依赖高质量平行数据，对类型学差异大或低资源语言效果不稳定。本研究旨在探索是否必须使用所有语言进行对齐，还是通过策略性选择语言子集能达到类似甚至更好的效果。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较使用全语言对齐与使用精心选择的语言子集进行词对齐的效果，特别关注对低资源语言的影响。

Result: 实验表明，词对齐对低资源语言特别有效，使用语言多样性好的子集可以匹配全语言对齐的效果，对于未见过的低资源语言甚至表现更好。

Conclusion: 有效的词对齐不需要覆盖所有语言，通过明智的语言选择可以减少数据收集成本，同时保持高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Realignment is a promising strategy to improve cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种任务感知的后训练量化方法TAQ和TAQO，通过识别任务相关层并保持其精度，同时激进量化其他层，实现高效的任务专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练量化方法多为任务无关的，忽略了任务特定信号在不同层的分布，导致大模型在仅需有限能力的应用中存在内存和延迟效率低下的问题。

Method: TAQ使用隐藏激活中的任务条件统计来分配比特宽度，TAQO基于直接层敏感性测试分配精度。两种方法都从小校准集中识别任务相关层。

Result: 在多个模型上，TAQ和TAQO均优于基线方法。TAQ在Phi-4上表现最佳，TAQO在Llama-3.1、Qwen3和Qwen2.5上领先。例如在Phi-4上达到42.33 EM/50.81 F1，远超AWQ方法。

Conclusion: 任务感知量化方法能够稳定地保持任务敏感性，在较低平均精度下实现接近原始模型的准确率，为构建高效的任务专用模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks, yet many applications require only limited capabilities, making large variants inefficient in memory and latency. Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.

TL;DR: RefineLab是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能在可控token预算下自动将原始QA文本数据优化为高质量数据集，通过选择性编辑操作提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专家构建的QA数据集存在领域覆盖不足、难度分布不匹配和事实不一致等问题，而生成模型创建的数据集进一步加剧了质量挑战。

Method: RefineLab将QA数据集优化建模为约束优化问题，在预设token预算内，通过分配模块选择最佳优化策略（如重述、干扰项替换等）来最大化数据集质量。

Result: 实验表明RefineLab在覆盖范围、难度对齐、事实保真度和干扰项质量方面持续缩小与专家数据集的差距。

Conclusion: RefineLab为可复现的数据集设计开创了可扩展、可定制的路径，对LLM评估具有广泛意义。

Abstract: High-quality Question-Answer (QA) datasets are foundational for reliable Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, yet even expert-crafted datasets exhibit persistent gaps in domain coverage, misaligned difficulty distributions, and factual inconsistencies. The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ibom数据集，这是一个针对尼日利亚阿夸伊博姆州四种沿海语言（Anaang、Efik、Ibibio、Oro）的机器翻译和主题分类数据集，填补了这些语言在主要基准测试中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尼日利亚拥有500多种语言，但NLP研究主要集中于豪萨语、伊博语等少数语言（不到1%）。这些沿海语言在Google Translate、Flores-200等主要基准中缺乏代表性，缺乏训练NLP算法的文本数据。

Method: 扩展Flores-200基准到四种目标语言，并将翻译文本与基于SIB-200分类数据集的主题标签对齐，构建ibom数据集。

Result: 评估显示当前LLM在零样本和少样本设置下对这些语言的机器翻译表现不佳，但少样本样本能稳步提高主题分类性能。

Conclusion: 需要更多针对低资源语言的数据集和基准，以促进NLP研究的包容性和多样性。

Abstract: Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of more than 200 million people. More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得了显著进展，但其内部机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在探索从LLM的单个最后token表示中恢复原始输入文本的程度。

Method: 提出Rep2Text框架，使用可训练适配器将目标模型的内部表示投影到解码语言模型的嵌入空间，然后自回归地重建输入文本。

Result: 实验表明平均能恢复16个token序列中超过一半的信息，同时保持语义完整性。发现信息瓶颈效应：较长序列的token级恢复率下降但语义完整性保持良好。

Conclusion: Rep2Text能够从压缩表示中有效恢复文本信息，并在医学数据等分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.

Motivation: 解决传统解析方法在处理表格数据时性能不佳的问题，同时避免微调嵌入模型的高计算成本

Method: 使用结构化语言表示来处理表格密集型文档的解析式RAG管道

Result: 在生成和检索任务上优于现有的流行解析方法

Conclusion: TabRAG为表格密集型文档提供了一种有效的解析式RAG解决方案

Abstract: Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.

TL;DR: 音频大语言模型在临床决策中存在严重的模态偏见，基于患者声音特征而非医疗证据做出判断，可能导致医疗差异扩大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型从文本界面转向音频交互，可能通过音频中的副语言线索引入新的脆弱性，需要评估其在临床环境中的表现

Method: 使用170个临床案例，将其合成为36种不同声音配置（涵盖年龄、性别和情感变化）的语音，比较音频与文本输入的差异

Result: 发现严重模态偏见：音频输入的手术建议比相同文本输入差异高达35%，一个模型提供80%更少的建议；年龄差异达12%，思维链提示无法消除；性别偏见可通过显式推理消除；情感影响因识别性能差未检测到

Conclusion: 音频LLM容易基于患者声音特征而非医疗证据做出临床决策，存在扩大医疗差异的风险，在临床部署前迫切需要开发偏见感知架构

Abstract: As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.

Result: 通过二项式组合学和香农熵分析量化了表达多样性和复杂度降低的程度，识别了边际修辞比特（MRB），定义了衡量表达增长速度的修辞可扩展参数。

Conclusion: 该工作将静态不可测量的修辞分类转化为动态可测量的系统，为未来AI系统在分层修辞推理结构上的操作提供了可能路径，连接了语言学、教育学、学术和计算研究。

Abstract: Rhetorical modes are useful in both academic and non-academic writing, and can be subjects to be studied within linguistic research and computational modeling. Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research

Motivation: 随着AI驱动的审核系统普及，人们担心算法偏见可能导致内容被错误标记为'不当'，特别是对某些语言变体的歧视性处理。

Method: 采用双重方法：1）对广泛使用的毒性模型进行定量基准测试，比较非裔美国英语和标准美国英语的性能差异；2）开发交互式教学工具，通过用户控制的'敏感度阈值'使抽象偏见具体化。

Result: 基准测试显示明确系统性偏见：模型平均将非裔美国英语评为毒性高1.8倍，身份仇恨高8.8倍。工具展示了偏见分数本身不是唯一危害，人类设定的看似中立的政策最终操作化了歧视。

Conclusion: 这项工作既提供了差异影响的统计证据，又开发了面向公众的工具，旨在培养批判性AI素养，揭示算法偏见如何通过人类政策转化为实际歧视。

Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.

Conclusion: 建立了一个面向目标导向、包容性方言翻译的稳健框架，提供了严格的评估方法和对模型性能的关键洞察。

Abstract: Standard-to-dialect machine translation remains challenging due to a persistent dialect gap in large language models and evaluation distortions inherent in n-gram metrics, which favor source copying over authentic dialect translation. In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.

Conclusion: TSAN提供了一种无需参数更新的有效测试时偏好优化方法，通过自然语言自注意力机制成功利用多个候选解决方案的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.

Result: 标准RAG往往降低性能：仅22%的前16个段落相关，证据选择精度41-43%、召回率27-49%，事实性和完整性分别下降达6%和5%。但通过证据过滤和查询重构，在MedMCQA和MedXpertQA上的性能分别提升达12%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视RAG在医学中的作用，强调阶段感知评估和精心系统设计对于可靠医学LLM应用的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of medicine, yet two fundamental challenges persist: keeping up with rapidly evolving medical knowledge and providing verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.

*Nicy Scaria,Silvester John Joseph Kennedy,Deepak Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了23个小语言模型（2.7亿到40亿参数）在指令微调过程中对数据污染的鲁棒性，发现句法变换（如字符和单词反转）会导致灾难性性能下降，而语义变换（如无关和反事实响应）表现出阈值行为和更强的语言能力恢复力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型越来越多地部署在资源受限环境中，但其在指令微调过程中对数据污染的行为鲁棒性仍缺乏系统研究。

Method: 通过测量23个SLM对句法变换（字符和单词反转）和语义变换（无关和反事实响应）的敏感性，每种变换在25%、50%、75%和100%的污染水平下进行测试。

Result: 发现句法变换导致灾难性性能下降，字符反转在所有模型中都产生近乎完全失败；语义变换表现出阈值行为和更强的语言能力恢复力；发现'能力诅咒'现象，即更大、更有能力的模型更容易学习语义污染。

Conclusion: 当前对小模型鲁棒性的假设可能不成立，需要开发污染感知的训练协议，并建立了系统评估污染鲁棒性的协议。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly being deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet their behavioral robustness to data contamination during instruction tuning remains poorly understood. We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\textit{capability curse}" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.

TL;DR: SafeNlidb是一个针对基于LLM的NLIDB系统的隐私安全对齐框架，通过自动生成混合思维链数据和安全推理优化，解决LLM在数据库交互中的数据泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在NLIDB应用中存在严重隐私安全问题，可能无意暴露数据库内容或被攻击者利用进行数据窃取，现有方法难以应对复杂推理攻击且误报率高。

Method: 提出自动化流水线生成混合思维链交互数据，结合推理预热和交替偏好优化，使LLM能够进行细粒度安全推理并生成安全SQL，无需人工标注偏好数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于更大规模LLM和理想设定基线，在保持高实用性的同时显著提升安全性。

Conclusion: SafeNlidb框架有效解决了LLM-based NLIDB的隐私安全问题，实现了安全性与实用性的平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB). However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!

### [60] [Learning to Focus: Focal Attention for Selective and Scalable Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06818)
*Dhananjay Ram,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Focal Attention通过控制softmax温度来锐化注意力分布，使模型能更专注于相关token，在模型大小、训练数据和上下文长度方面比标准transformer更具可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力通常产生噪声概率分布，这会损害transformer模型各层的有效特征选择，特别是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 提出Focal Attention，通过控制softmax温度来锐化注意力分布，温度可以作为固定超参数或训练中的可学习参数。

Result: 在相同准确率下，Focal Attention可节省高达42%的参数或33%的训练数据；在长上下文任务中，相对改进范围从17%到82%。

Conclusion: Focal Attention是一种简单有效的注意力机制改进，在多种基准测试中表现出色，特别是在长上下文应用中效果显著。

Abstract: Attention is a core component of transformer architecture, whether encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder model. However, the standard softmax attention often produces noisy probability distribution, which can impair effective feature selection at every layer of these models, particularly for long contexts. We propose Focal Attention, a simple yet effective modification that sharpens the attention distribution by controlling the softmax temperature, either as a fixed hyperparameter or as a learnable parameter during training. This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length. Across diverse benchmarks, it achieves the same accuracy with up to 42% fewer parameters or 33% less training data. On long-context tasks, it delivers substantial relative improvements ranging from 17% to 82%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DA4ICL是一个用于阿尔茨海默病检测的演示中心锚定框架，通过多样化对比检索扩展上下文宽度，通过投影向量锚定在每个Transformer层深化信号，显著提升了ICL和任务向量方法在OOD任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在阿尔茨海默病检测任务中面临挑战：预训练很少覆盖这种分布外任务，且所有转录本描述相同场景导致上下文高度同质化，这削弱了模型的任务认知和上下文感知能力。

Method: 提出DA4ACL框架，联合使用多样化对比检索(DCR)扩展上下文宽度，以及投影向量锚定(PVA)在每个Transformer层深化每个演示的信号。

Result: 在三个AD基准测试中，DA4ICL相比ICL和任务向量基线实现了大幅且稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: DA4ICL为细粒度、分布外和低资源LLM适应开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from narrative transcripts challenges large language models (LLMs): pre-training rarely covers this out-of-distribution task, and all transcript demos describe the same scene, producing highly homogeneous contexts. These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \emph{\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \emph{\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLiFT-ASR是一个针对低资源语言（如台湾闽南语）的跨语言语音识别框架，通过两阶段渐进式微调，结合拼音和汉字标注，显著降低了字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言语音识别中标注数据稀缺的问题。传统方法单独使用汉字标注或拼音标注都有局限性：汉字标注无法捕捉详细语音和声调特征，拼音标注缺乏词汇和句法覆盖。

Method: 基于普通话HuBERT模型的两阶段跨语言微调框架：第一阶段从拼音标注学习声学和声调表示，第二阶段从汉字转录学习词汇和句法。

Result: 在TAT-MOE语料库上实验显示，相比强基线模型，CLiFT-ASR实现了24.88%的相对字符错误率降低。

Conclusion: CLiFT-ASR为台湾闽南语语音识别提供了有效且参数高效的解决方案，并具有推广到其他低资源语言场景的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages such as Taiwanese Hokkien is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated data. However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究实体角色检测问题，通过将其建模为命名实体识别(NER)和实体检索/排序任务来解决。在NER中，角色被视为互斥类别；在实体检索中，角色被表述为查询，实体作为检索集合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当实体根据其在特定上下文中的行为或属性扮演角色时，需要识别这些角色。传统实体类型(如人物、地点、组织)需要更细粒度的角色分类，但缺乏大规模领域特定数据集或知识库。

Method: 1) 将角色检测建模为NER任务，使用序列标注方法；2) 将角色检测建模为实体检索任务，角色作为查询，实体作为检索集合；3) 自动学习代表性词语和短语来构建角色和实体的表示；4) 探索句子和文档级别的上下文。

Result: 提出了自动化方法来学习代表性词语和短语，构建角色和实体的表示。在不同上下文(句子和文档)中进行了探索，并尝试在领域无关的方式下利用小数据集信息。

Conclusion: 实体角色检测可以通过NER和实体检索两种方法有效解决，特别是在缺乏大规模领域特定数据的情况下，可以利用小数据集以领域无关的方式进行学习。

Abstract: Most of the Natural Language Processing sys- tems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduGuardBench基准，用于评估作为教师的LLMs的专业保真度和伦理安全性，发现模型性能两极分化，推理模型保真度高但普遍存在能力不足，中等规模模型在对抗测试中最脆弱，并识别出教育转化效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法衡量角色扮演保真度或解决教育场景特有的教学危害，需要确保SP-LLMs作为教师的专业能力和伦理安全。

Method: 提出EduGuardBench双组件基准：使用角色扮演保真度评分(RFS)评估专业保真度，诊断教学职业特有危害；使用基于角色的对抗提示探测安全漏洞，评估攻击成功率(ASR)和三级拒绝质量。

Result: 对14个领先模型的实验显示性能两极分化：推理模型保真度高但能力不足是主要失败模式；对抗测试发现反直觉的规模悖论，中等规模模型最脆弱；识别出教育转化效应，最安全模型能将有害请求转化为教学时刻。

Conclusion: EduGuardBench提供了可复现框架，超越孤立知识测试，实现专业、伦理和教学对齐的全面评估，揭示了部署可信教育AI所需的复杂动态。

Abstract: Large Language Models for Simulating Professions (SP-LLMs), particularly as teachers, are pivotal for personalized education. However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估模型最终答案的正确性，而忽略了推理过程的质量，特别是当错误推理导致正确答案时无法识别问题。此外，现有方法没有考虑模态间关系对推理的影响。

Method: 提出Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS)指标，将推理步骤组织成树形结构，利用层次信息为每个推理步骤分配加权忠实度分数。构建RPTS-Eval基准，包含374张图像和390个推理实例，每个实例包含可靠的视觉-文本线索作为推理树的叶节点。

Result: 评估了代表性LVLMs（如GPT4o、Llava-Next），揭示了它们在多模态推理中的局限性，并突出了开源和闭源商业LVLMs之间的差异。

Conclusion: RPTS-Eval基准将有助于推动多模态推理领域的研究进展，为评估模型推理过程提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出HLPD方法，通过人类语言偏好优化来增强对机器修订文本的检测能力，在对抗性多任务评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决LLM生成可信内容导致错误信息和社交问题，需要开发高效可靠的文本来源识别方法。现有方法在处理高级LLM输出或对抗性多任务机器修订文本时表现不佳，特别是在黑盒设置下。

Method: 基于人类写作具有独特风格模式的假设，提出人类语言偏好检测(HLPD)，采用基于奖励的对齐过程HLPO，将评分模型的token分布转向人类写作风格，增强对人类写作的敏感性。

Result: 在检测GPT系列模型修订文本时，HLPD相比ImBD相对提升15.11% AUROC，相比Fast-DetectGPT提升45.56%。在高级LLM生成文本评估中，HLPD达到最高平均AUROC，超过ImBD 5.53%，超过Fast-DetectGPT 34.14%。

Conclusion: HLPD通过人类语言偏好优化有效提升了机器修订文本的检测性能，在对抗性多任务场景下表现出色，为LLM生成内容识别提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种无需参数更新或外部过滤器的推理时方法，通过稀疏自编码器将隐藏状态投影到高维近单语义空间，识别版权敏感子空间并在解码时钳制其激活，有效缓解版权侵权同时保持模型通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时会无意中复制受版权保护的内容，给下游应用带来法律风险。现有推理时防御方法主要关注表层token匹配，依赖外部黑名单或过滤器，增加了部署复杂性且可能忽略语义层面的泄露。

Method: 将版权侵权缓解重新定义为内在语义空间控制，使用稀疏自编码器将隐藏状态投影到高维近单语义空间，识别版权敏感子空间并在解码过程中钳制其激活。

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，SCOPE能够缓解版权侵权问题，同时不会降低模型的通用性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE提供了一种有效的推理时版权侵权缓解方法，无需参数更新或外部过滤器，且可解释性分析证实了隔离子空间能够捕获高级语义信息。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes inadvertently reproduce passages that are copyrighted, exposing downstream applications to legal risk. Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility. Further interpretability analyses confirm that the isolated subspace captures high-level semantics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为probe prompting的自动化方法，用于将神经网络的归因图转化为紧凑、可解释的子图，通过概念对齐的超级节点来简化特征路径分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械可解释性研究需要理解神经网络中哪些学习到的特征介导特定行为，但归因图的解释需要大量手动分析（单个提示约需2小时），因此需要自动化方法来压缩复杂性。

Method: 从种子提示和目标logit开始，选择高影响力特征，生成概念导向但上下文变化的探针，使用透明决策规则将特征按跨提示激活特征分组为语义、关系和Say-X类别。

Result: 在五个提示测试中，probe-prompted子图保持了高解释覆盖率同时压缩了复杂性（完整性0.83，替换度0.54）。与几何聚类基线相比，概念对齐组表现出更高的行为一致性：峰值标记一致性高2.3倍，激活模式相似度高5.8倍。

Conclusion: 实体交换测试揭示了层级结构：早期层特征稳健转移（64%转移率），而晚期层Say-X特征专门用于输出促进，支持了transformer计算的主干-专业化视图。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.
  Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.
  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly advanced Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT), yet the broad language coverage, consistent translation quality, and English-centric bias remain open challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LMT}, a suite of \textbf{L}arge-scale \textbf{M}ultilingual \textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin. We release LMT in four sizes (0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B) to catalyze future research and provide strong baselines for inclusive, scalable, and high-quality MMT \footnote{\href{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}}.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，通过自动错误检测和纠正来解决训练数据质量问题，然后进行参数高效的模型微调，在英语-印度语言翻译任务中取得了BLEU分数的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练数据中的质量问题，包括视觉歧义和翻译错误，以提高英语到印度语言翻译的性能。

Method: 采用视觉增强的法官-纠正器管道，利用多模态语言模型系统识别和纠正训练数据中的翻译错误，然后使用LoRA对IndicTrans2模型进行参数高效的微调。

Result: 在四个语言对中，纠正了平均17.1%的标题，使用纠正后的数据进行训练带来了BLEU分数的持续提升，如英语-孟加拉语在评估集上从42.00提升到43.30。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法有效提升了英语-印度语言翻译的质量，证明了数据质量改进和参数高效微调的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our system under the team name BLEU Monday for the English-to-Indic Multimodal Translation Task at WAT 2025. We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.
  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.
  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).

Method: 使用mLSTM线性注意力机制替代自注意力，结合短卷积、滑动窗口注意力、Hedgehog特征图等技术，并采用Muon优化器替代AdamW。

Result: 实验表明线性注意力与滑动窗口注意力结合能持续提升零样本性能，Muon优化器比AdamW更稳定且降低困惑度。

Conclusion: 证明了在不依赖模型规模的情况下，通过架构和优化技术的创新可以实现高效的语言建模。

Abstract: We study architectural and optimization techniques for sample-efficient language modeling under the constraints of the BabyLM 2025 shared task. Our model, BLaLM, replaces self-attention with a linear-time mLSTM token mixer and explores lightweight enhancements, including short convolutions, sliding window attention with dynamic modulation, and Hedgehog feature maps. To support training in low-resource settings, we curate a high-quality corpus emphasizing readability and pedagogical structure. Experiments across both STRICT and STRICT-SMALL tracks show that (1) linear attention combined with sliding window attention consistently improves zero-shot performance, and (2) the Muon optimizer stabilizes convergence and reduces perplexity over AdamW. These results highlight effective strategies for efficient language modeling without relying on scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过移动设备收集的口语数据有潜力用于客观、定期评估抑郁症症状严重程度和早期复发检测，但现有研究主要基于非临床横断面样本的书面语言，且机器学习方法复杂、可解释性有限。

Method: 对英国、荷兰和西班牙586名参与者的5,836条录音进行纵向分析，使用线性混合效应模型识别与MDD症状严重程度相关的可解释词汇特征，并测试四种回归机器学习模型的预测性能。

Result: 英语数据中MDD症状严重程度与7个特征相关，包括词汇多样性测量和绝对主义语言；荷兰语中与句子词数和积极词频相关；西班牙语中未观察到关联。词汇特征和向量嵌入的预测能力在所有语言中都接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 需要在更大样本中使用改进协议和能处理个体内外语言变异的机器学习模型，进一步研究词汇标记在临床研究和实践中的价值。

Abstract: Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices, spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder. However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.

Conclusion: llama-embed-nemotron-8b结合了顶级性能、广泛适用性和用户驱动的灵活性，可作为通用的文本嵌入解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce llama-embed-nemotron-8b, an open-weights text embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multilingual Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) leaderboard as of October 21, 2025. While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging. The llama-embed-nemotron-8b is an instruction-aware model, supporting user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific use-cases. This combination of top-tier performance, broad applicability, and user-driven flexibility enables it to serve as a universal text embedding solution.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的模型在心理健康检测中表现有效，合成数据在提高召回率和泛化能力方面具有价值，但需要仔细校准以避免精度损失。结合先进语言模型和数据增强可以提升基于文本的自动化心理健康评估效果。

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over one-fifth of adults globally, yet detecting such conditions from text remains challenging due to the subtle and varied nature of symptom expression. This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization. However, careful calibration is required to prevent precision loss. Overall, this work emphasizes the potential of combining advanced language models and data augmentation to enhance automated mental health assessment from text.

Motivation: 特征归因方法通常只提供最小充分证据，但在合规和编目等应用中需要识别完整的贡献特征集。

Method: 在包含人工标注完整证据的医学数据集上进行案例研究，分析单个模型和集成模型在证据恢复方面的表现。

Result: 单个模型通常只能恢复完整证据的子集，证据召回率约0.60；集成多个模型可将证据召回率提升到约0.86。

Conclusion: 集成方法显著改善了证据召回率，分析了召回率-精确度权衡、证据训练的作用以及具有确定性阈值的动态集成。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications this is inadequate. For compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified - complete evidence. We perform a case study on a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. We show that individual models typically recover only subsets of complete evidence and that aggregating evidence from several models improves evidence recall from $\sim$0.60 (single best model) to $\sim$0.86 (ensemble). We analyze the recall-precision trade-off, the role of training with evidence, dynamic ensembles with certainty thresholds, and discuss implications.

Motivation: 深度学习模型的不透明性阻碍了仇恨言论检测系统的道德部署，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性。

Method: 在基于transformer的分类器中集成监督注意力机制，优化包含分类损失和注意力与人类理性标注对齐损失的联合目标函数。

Result: 在英语和葡萄牙语仇恨言论基准测试中，SRA实现了2.4倍更好的可解释性，产生更忠实和人类对齐的token级解释，同时在公平性方面表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 将人类理性标注整合到注意力机制中可以在不损害公平性的前提下增强可解释性和忠实度。

Abstract: The opaque nature of deep learning models presents significant challenges for the ethical deployment of hate speech detection systems. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.

Result: 实验表明仅选择MIWV排名前1%的数据进行训练，性能即可超越使用完整数据集

Conclusion: MIWV方法超越了现有基于数据质量评分的数据选择研究，为所提方法的有效性提供了强有力的实证证据

Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Emotion detection from text seeks to identify an individual's emotional or mental state - positive, negative, or neutral - based on linguistic cues. While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection. Experimental results show that EmoBangH and EmoBangE achieve accuracies of 92.86% and 93.69%, respectively, outperforming existing methods and establishing strong baselines for future research.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) depends heavily on the quality and scale of their pre-training datasets. Recent research shows that large multimodal models trained on natural documents where images and text are interleaved outperform those trained only on image-text pairs across a wide range of benchmarks, leveraging advanced pre- trained models to enforce semantic alignment, image-sequence consistency, and textual coherence. For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices. To support future research, we publicly release a representative dataset dump along with the multimodal processing pipeline for Arabic.

Method: 使用Agent Forest统一采样和投票框架，在四个数学基准上评估六个开源模型，智能体数量从1到25，对抗性扰动包括不同强度的标点噪声和真实世界拼写错误。

Result: 噪声类型影响显著：标点噪声危害随强度增加，人为拼写错误是主要瓶颈；智能体协作能提高准确率，但对抗性鲁棒性差距持续存在。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作能提高数学问题回答准确率，但无法有效解决对抗性鲁棒性问题，特别是对人为拼写错误的脆弱性。

Abstract: When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count.

Result: 在数学、常识和符号推理基准测试中显著提高了LLM多步推理的一致性和效率

Conclusion: EBM-CoT框架能够在不修改基础语言模型的情况下有效提升推理的一致性和准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

*Seungeon Lee,Soumi Das,Manish Gupta,Krishna P. Gummadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA on the Go (LoGo) 是一个无需训练的框架，能够在实例级别动态选择和合并LoRA适配器，无需额外数据或训练，在多样化任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA适配器通常针对单一任务训练，限制了在现实世界多样化任务中的应用。现有方法需要标注数据或额外训练，成本高昂。

Method: LoGo利用单次前向传播从LoRA适配器中提取信号，动态识别最相关的适配器并实时确定其贡献，无需训练。

Result: 在5个NLP基准测试、27个数据集和3个模型系列上，LoGo在某些任务上比基于训练的方法高出3.6%，在其他任务上保持竞争力，同时保持推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: LoGo是一个有效且实用的训练免费框架，能够在多样化任务上动态选择和合并LoRA适配器，提升性能同时保持效率。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.However, conventional LoRA adapters are typically trained for a single task, limiting their applicability in real-world settings where inputs may span diverse and unpredictable domains. At inference time, existing approaches combine multiple LoRAs for improving performance on diverse tasks, while usually requiring labeled data or additional task-specific training, which is expensive at scale. In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly. Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在现代医学中表现出色，但在中医领域应用受限，缺乏标准化基准和高质量训练数据。

Method: 从国家医学资格考试构建TCM-Eval基准，使用SI-CoTE方法通过拒绝采样自动丰富问答对，建立数据与模型协同进化的良性循环。

Result: 开发了ZhiMingTang模型，显著超过人类从业者的通过标准，并发布了公共排行榜。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了中医领域LLM评估的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和工具，促进了社区参与和持续改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

*Lynn Greschner,Meike Bauer,Sabine Weber,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了评价理论在论证情感分析中的适用性，发现评价比分类情感信息更能提升说服力预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证的说服力不仅取决于逻辑结构和论证者信誉，还取决于引发的情感。现有研究关注情感强度和类别，但情感是主观的，取决于接收者的目标、标准和立场。评价理论作为主观认知评估与情感之间的桥梁，在论证说服力评估中的适用性尚未探索。

Method: 基于ContArgA语料库的标注，进行零样本提示实验，评估黄金标注和预测的情感及评价对主观说服力标签预测的重要性。

Result: 分类情感信息确实能改善说服力预测，但评价带来的改善更为显著。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统比较情感模型在说服力预测中的表现，证明了评价的优势，为计算论证的理论和实践应用提供了见解。

Abstract: The convincingness of an argument does not only depend on its structure (logos), the person who makes the argument (ethos), but also on the emotion that it causes in the recipient (pathos). While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.

*Meiyun Wang,Charin Polpanumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaRec是一个基于大语言模型的少样本上下文学习框架，通过叙事化画像将用户-物品交互转化为自然语言表示，实现自适应个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法需要手动特征工程，且难以处理少样本和零样本场景，特别是长尾个性化问题。

Method: 采用双变量推理范式，结合水平行为对齐（发现同伴驱动模式）和垂直因果归因（突出用户偏好的决定性因素），通过语义表示消除手动特征工程。

Result: 在真实电商数据集上，AdaRec在少样本设置中比机器学习和LLM基线模型提升高达8%，在零样本场景中比专家构建的画像提升19%。轻量级微调可达到完全微调模型的性能。

Conclusion: AdaRec通过语义表示和双通道架构，在少样本和零样本场景中实现了有效的个性化推荐，特别适合长尾用户，且具有高效的跨任务适应能力。

Abstract: We propose AdaRec, a few-shot in-context learning framework that leverages large language models for an adaptive personalized recommendation. AdaRec introduces narrative profiling, transforming user-item interactions into natural language representations to enable unified task handling and enhance human readability. Centered on a bivariate reasoning paradigm, AdaRec employs a dual-channel architecture that integrates horizontal behavioral alignment, discovering peer-driven patterns, with vertical causal attribution, highlighting decisive factors behind user preferences. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, it achieves up to a nineteen percent improvement over expert-crafted profiling, showing effectiveness for long-tail personalization with minimal interaction data. Furthermore, lightweight fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by AdaRec matches the performance of fully fine-tuned models, highlighting its efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks.

*Jiacheng Huang,Ning Yu,Xiaoyin Yi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EMODIS基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在最小但对比性文本语境下解析歧义表情符号的能力，发现即使最强模型也难以区分细微语境线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地部署在真实世界通信环境中，但其解析语境依赖歧义的能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 创建EMODIS基准测试，每个实例包含一个含表情符号的歧义句子、两个导致不同解释的消歧语境，以及需要语境推理的具体问题。评估了开源和API-based的LLMs。

Result: 即使最强模型也经常无法在仅有细微语境线索时区分含义。分析显示存在系统性偏向主导解释和对语用对比的有限敏感性。

Conclusion: EMODIS为评估语境消歧提供了严谨测试平台，突显了人类与LLMs在语义推理方面的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world communication settings, yet their ability to resolve context-dependent ambiguity remains underexplored. In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present. Further analysis reveals systematic biases toward dominant interpretations and limited sensitivity to pragmatic contrast. EMODIS provides a rigorous testbed for assessing contextual disambiguation, and highlights the gap in semantic reasoning between humans and LLMs.

TL;DR: TransGraph是一个基于语篇图的文档级翻译框架，通过显式建模语篇关系来提升翻译质量和术语一致性，同时降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在文档级翻译中难以捕捉长距离依赖和保持语篇连贯性，而多智能体翻译系统虽然缓解了上下文窗口限制，但计算资源需求大且对记忆检索策略敏感。

Method: 引入TransGraph框架，通过结构化语篇图显式建模语块间关系，并选择性地将每个翻译片段基于相关图邻域进行条件化，而非依赖顺序或全面上下文。

Result: 在涵盖6种语言和多个领域的三个文档级机器翻译基准测试中，TransGraph在翻译质量和术语一致性方面持续超越强基线，同时显著降低token开销。

Conclusion: TransGraph通过语篇引导的图结构方法有效解决了文档级翻译中的长距离依赖和语篇连贯性问题，在保持高质量翻译的同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to full document translation remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies and preserving discourse coherence throughout extended texts. While recent agentic machine translation systems mitigate context window constraints through multi-agent orchestration and persistent memory, they require substantial computational resources and are sensitive to memory retrieval strategies. We introduce TransGraph, a discourse-guided framework that explicitly models inter-chunk relationships through structured discourse graphs and selectively conditions each translation segment on relevant graph neighbourhoods rather than relying on sequential or exhaustive context. Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了主角实体识别（PER）任务，用于识别新闻故事中锚定叙事并推动主要发展的组织实体，而不是传统NER将所有提及同等对待。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NER将所有组织实体提及同等对待，无法识别真正驱动叙事的关键实体，限制了依赖事件显著性、影响力或叙事焦点的下游任务。

Method: 通过比较LLM预测与四位专家标注者的注释来验证PER，使用NER引导提示自动标注大规模新闻集合，并评估LLM在有限上下文和无明确候选指导下的表现。

Result: 研究结果表明PER是可行的且有意义的叙事中心信息提取扩展，引导的LLM能够大规模近似人类对叙事重要性的判断。

Conclusion: PER任务可行且有意义，LLM能够有效识别新闻叙事中的主角实体，为叙事中心的信息提取提供了新的方向。

Abstract: News articles often reference numerous organizations, but traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) treats all mentions equally, obscuring which entities genuinely drive the narrative. This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Bangla hate speech identification, a socially impactful yet linguistically challenging task. As part of the "Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team "Retriv" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively. These results highlight the promise of transformer ensembles and weighted multitask frameworks for advancing Bangla hate speech detection in low-resource contexts. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注代码层次结构和同义词理解，但忽视了临床笔记中普遍使用的医学术语缩写对ICD编码推断的关键影响。

Method: 使用大型语言模型扩展医学术语缩写为完整形式，并采用一致性训练来正则化预测，强制原始文档和增强文档之间的预测一致性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在常见代码、罕见代码和完整代码分配等多个设置下都建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的ACE-ICD方法通过有效处理医学术语缩写问题，显著提升了自动ICD编码的性能，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing. While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RLVE方法，使用可验证环境动态调整问题难度分布来扩展语言模型的强化学习，通过RLVE-Gym套件展示环境扩展能持续提升推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据分布在问题过于简单或困难时会导致学习信号消失，需要动态适应模型能力的环境

Method: 开发RLVE-Gym套件包含400个可验证环境，使用RLVE方法让环境根据策略模型能力动态调整问题难度分布

Result: 在400个环境上联合训练使1.5B推理LM在6个推理基准上平均提升3.37%，而原始RL训练仅提升0.49%但计算量多3倍以上

Conclusion: 环境扩展能持续提升通用推理能力，RLVE方法比传统RL训练更有效

Abstract: We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得显著进展，但仍存在生成看似合理但实际错误的幻觉问题，特别是由训练数据中特征与属性之间的伪相关性所驱动的幻觉尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过系统控制的合成实验和对最先进开源及专有LLMs（包括GPT-5）的实证评估，分析现有幻觉检测方法在伪相关性存在时的失效情况，并进行理论分析。

Result: 现有幻觉检测方法（如基于置信度的过滤和内部状态探测）在面对伪相关性时基本失效，这种幻觉具有自信生成、不受模型规模影响、逃避当前检测方法等特点。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了迫切需要开发专门针对伪相关性引起的幻觉的新方法，因为统计偏差本质上破坏了基于置信度的检测技术。

Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.

Abstract: While LLMs have shown great success in financial tasks like stock prediction and question answering, their application in fully automating Equity Research Report generation remains uncharted territory. In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent framework specifically tailored to address this task, named FinRpt-Gen, and train several LLM-based agents on the proposed datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results indicate the data quality and metrics effectiveness of the benchmark FinRpt and the strong performance of FinRpt-Gen, showcasing their potential to drive innovation in the ERR generation field.

Method: 提出NTK-Selector框架，通过经验证明LLMs在LoRA微调中表现出稳定的类NTK行为，并提出无雅可比近似方法来解决计算成本问题。

Result: 在四个低资源领域实验中，使用NTK-Selector选择的9,000个辅助样本使Llama3-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得+8.7和+5.1分的提升，相比仅使用1,000个领域内样本的10.9倍和5.7倍改进。

Conclusion: NTK-Selector能有效选择通用领域辅助数据，显著提升低资源领域的大语言模型性能，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across widespread tasks, yet their application in low-resource domains remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the high risk of overfitting. While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \textbf{\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）在代码生成任务中代表性不足的问题，由于缺乏指令到代码的数据集和评估基准。

Method: 使用微调的Qwen2.5-14B模型，结合指令提示和测试驱动的反馈引导迭代精炼过程，通过三次评估轮次利用测试反馈指导每一步优化。

Result: 在BLP Workshop共享任务中获得第二名，Pass@1分数达到0.934。

Conclusion: 分析突出了孟加拉语指令理解和Python代码生成中的挑战，强调在低资源语言中需要有针对性的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the automated generation of code from natural language prompts. However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on "Code Generation in Bangla". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team "Retriv" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934. The analysis highlights challenges in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation, emphasizing the need for targeted methods in LRLs. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

Result: 在数学任务上，转换后的循环模型在相同计算预算下比直接后训练非循环模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过渐进式循环转换方法，可以在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为预训练模型的效率优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in depth-recurrent language models show that recurrence can decouple train-time compute and parameter count from test-time compute. In this work, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models into depth-recurrent models. We find that using a curriculum of recurrences to increase the effective depth of the model over the course of training preserves performance while reducing total computational cost. In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.

Motivation: 在达芬奇机器人手术中，外科医生的手眼完全投入手术过程，难以在不中断手术的情况下访问和操作多模态患者数据。

Method: 构建基于分层多智能体框架的语音导向手术协调平台，包含协调智能体和三个由LLM驱动的任务特定智能体，能够自主规划、优化、验证和推理语音命令。

Abstract: In da Vinci robotic surgery, surgeons' hands and eyes are fully engaged in the procedure, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient data without interruption. We propose a voice-directed Surgical Agent Orchestrator Platform (SAOP) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework, consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to map voice commands into specific tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models on the surgical video. We also introduce a Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives. The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话语音代理的延迟问题：云端大模型推理能力强但延迟高，设备端模型响应快但能力有限

Method: 提出对话填充任务，训练360M参数的ConvFill模型，在设备端生成上下文对话同时无缝整合云端模型的流式知识

Result: ConvFill相比同规模独立小模型准确率提升36-42%，响应延迟始终低于200ms

Conclusion: 对话填充方法有望构建既响应迅速又知识丰富的设备端对话代理

Abstract: Deploying conversational voice agents with large language models faces a critical challenge: cloud-based foundation models provide deep reasoning and domain knowledge but introduce latency that disrupts natural conversation, while on-device models respond immediately but lack sophistication. We propose conversational infill, a task where a lightweight on-device model generates contextually appropriate dialogue while seamlessly incorporating streaming knowledge from a powerful backend model. This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable.

TL;DR: SPOT是首个将社会学概念"停止点"转化为可复现NLP任务的标注语料库，包含43,305条法文Facebook评论，用于识别暂停或重定向在线讨论的临界干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架如反言论或社会纠正往往忽视通过讽刺、微妙怀疑或片段化论证等方式暂停或重定向在线讨论的普通临界干预，需要将这一社会学概念转化为可操作的NLP任务。

Method: 将停止点概念操作化为二元分类任务，提供可靠标注指南。使用微调的编码器模型(CamemBERT)和指令调优的LLM在不同提示策略下进行基准测试，并整合上下文元数据。

Result: 微调的编码器模型在F1分数上比提示LLM高出10多个百分点，确认监督学习对新兴非英语社交媒体任务的重要性。整合上下文元数据后编码器模型的F1分数从0.75提升到0.78。

Conclusion: 监督学习对于新兴非英语社交媒体任务至关重要，上下文元数据能显著提升模型性能。发布匿名数据集、标注指南和代码以促进透明度和可复现研究。

Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.

*Ruiying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EviBound是一个证据绑定的执行框架，通过双治理门消除虚假声明，要求机器可检查的证据来确保研究完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的自主研究代理经常报告虚假声明，即使缺少工件、存在矛盾指标或执行失败也标记为"完成"，需要解决这种不可靠性问题。

Method: 采用双治理门机制：预执行批准门验证接受标准模式，后执行验证门通过MLflow API查询验证工件和指标。声明只有在有可查询的运行ID、必需工件和FINISHED状态时才能传播。

Result: 在8个基准任务评估中，基线A有100%幻觉率，基线B降至25%，而EviBound实现0%幻觉率：7/8任务验证通过，1个任务在批准门正确阻止，仅产生约8.3%执行开销。

Conclusion: 研究完整性是一个架构属性，通过治理门实现，而非从模型规模中涌现。EviBound框架有效消除了虚假声明问题。

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

Motivation: LLMs的快速扩张带来了前所未有的能源需求，推理工作负载通常占生命周期总能耗的主要部分，但系统性的推理能耗分析仍然有限。

Method: 使用vLLM推理引擎进行大规模测量，在提示级别量化能耗，分析架构和操作因素对能耗的影响，并开发预测模型。

Result: 识别了架构和操作因素如何塑造能源需求，开发了能够准确估计未见架构和硬件上推理能耗的预测模型。

Conclusion: 实现了能耗预测模型并将其作为浏览器扩展实施，以提高对生成式AI环境影响的认识。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

Motivation: CoT推理虽然提升了LLMs的问题解决能力，但带来了显著的推理开销，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。需要一种高效的方法在不同规模和架构的模型间迁移CoT能力。

Method: 自适应推理摘要框架，包括语义分割与重要性评分、预算感知动态压缩、连贯性重建，以及基于高斯过程的贝叶斯优化模块来降低评估成本。

Result: 在7,501个医学考试问题上，相比截断方法在相同token预算下准确率提升高达40%；在64个模型对上的评估证实了强跨模型可迁移性；贝叶斯优化将评估成本降低84%。

Conclusion: 推理摘要为实现高效的CoT迁移提供了实用路径，能够在严格的计算约束下实现高级推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 研究LLMs中观察到的认知偏见是表面模仿还是深层概率变化，锚定偏见作为经典人类判断偏见提供了关键测试案例。

Method: 使用对数概率行为分析、Shapley值归因和统一的锚定偏见敏感度评分，在六个开源模型上进行实验。

Result: Gemma-2B、Phi-2和Llama-2-7B表现出稳健的锚定效应，而GPT-2、Falcon-RW-1B和GPT-Neo-125M等较小模型表现不一，表明规模可能调节敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs中的锚定偏见是稳健、可测量和可解释的，但在应用领域存在风险，该框架为评估其他认知偏见提供了可复现路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs作为后处理推理器而非端到端预测器时，可以在混合诊断流程中作为有效的沟通工具。

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

Method: 将幻觉检测问题建模为动态策略学习问题，使用教师模型生成轨迹并动态调整策略，通过智能体调优将动态规划能力蒸馏到学生模型，并采用主动修正机制

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，LEAP调优的模型优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: LEAP框架成功解决了幻觉检测中的策略适应性问题，为LLM的安全部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探索思考型LLMs在代码生成中显式中间推理链的质量，这些推理链虽然能提高透明度和准确性，但其质量尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 评估6种先进推理LLMs在100个不同难度代码生成任务上的表现，通过步骤计数、冗长度量化推理链结构，进行受控步骤预算调整，并开展21人参与的人工评估。

Result: 目标步骤增加可提升某些模型/任务的解决率，适度减少步骤在标准任务上通常能保持成功但在困难任务上很少能保持。困难问题比标准任务更容易出现不完整性错误。

Conclusion: 思考型LLMs在软件工程中具有一致性逻辑结构和自我纠错能力，但推理质量受任务复杂度显著影响，完整性是主要限制因素。

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.

Motivation: 现有多模态虚假信息基准存在模态偏差，检测器可能仅依赖单一模态进行预测，而现有方法缺乏样本级洞察且难以扩展到海量在线信息。

Method: 提出三种偏差量化方法：1）粗粒度的模态效益评估；2）中粒度的信息流量化；3）细粒度的因果分析。在两个流行基准上进行人工评估验证。

Result: 实验发现三个重要发现：1）多视图集成对可靠自动化分析至关重要；2）自动化分析易受检测器引起的波动影响；3）不同视图在模态平衡样本上一致性更高，在偏差样本上分歧更大。

Conclusion: 研究为未来研究方向提供了潜在方向，强调了多视图集成的重要性，并揭示了自动化分析在样本级模态偏差识别中的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体通常在静态执行框架中运行，缺乏从自身经验中学习和自我改进的机制，导致性能受限于初始框架设计和基础LLM能力。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，智能体从初始执行中归纳出简洁的计划抽象，提炼关键步骤、依赖关系和约束，然后将学习到的抽象作为上下文指导反馈给智能体，优化其策略。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified基准测试中，SAGE与Mini-SWE-Agent和OpenHands CodeAct代理框架分别达到73.2%和74%的Pass@1解决率，相比Mini-SWE-Agent基线相对性能提升7.2%。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过自我抽象学习机制，能够持续提升LLM智能体在软件工程任务中的性能，且在不同LLM骨干和代理架构上均表现出稳定的性能增益。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScRPO是一个新颖的强化学习框架，通过自我反思和错误纠正来增强大语言模型在数学问题上的表现，包含试错学习和自我纠正两个阶段，在多个数学推理基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在具有挑战性的数学问题上表现不佳的问题，通过自我反思和错误纠正机制来提升模型性能，特别是在外部反馈有限的情况下实现自我改进。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 试错学习阶段：使用GRPO训练模型并收集错误答案和对应问题到错误池；2) 自我纠正学习阶段：引导模型反思先前答案错误的原因。

Result: 在AIME、AMC、Olympiad、MATH-500、GSM8k等多个数学推理基准测试中，使用Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和7B模型，ScRPO始终优于多种后训练方法。

Conclusion: ScRPO是一个有前景的范式，使语言模型能够在外部反馈有限的情况下对困难任务进行自我改进，为构建更可靠和强大的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathematical problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collecting incorrect answers along with their corresponding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous answers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The experimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Maestro框架，通过角色编排解决多智能体系统中的探索-合成认知张力问题，结合CLPO强化学习实现更好的信用分配和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统难以平衡解决方案空间的广泛探索与最优解的收敛合成，导致过早共识、错误传播和信用分配问题。

Method: Maestro框架：并行执行代理负责多样化探索，中央代理负责收敛合成；CLPO方法：结合决策策略梯度和理由列表排序损失，实现清洁信用分配。

Result: 在数学推理和通用问题解决基准测试中，Maestro+CLPO相比现有最先进多智能体方法平均绝对准确率提升6%，最高提升10%。

Conclusion: Maestro框架通过结构化解耦探索和合成模式，结合CLPO的强化学习目标，有效解决了多智能体协作中的核心认知挑战。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

TL;DR: DLPWM是一种无监督解耦的物体中心世界模型，虽然在视觉重建和预测方面表现良好，但在下游控制任务中表现不如DreamerV3，主要原因是多物体交互时的表征漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物体中心世界模型能否通过解耦的物体级表征来提升强化学习中的组合泛化能力和数据效率。

Method: 开发了DLPWM，一种完全无监督的解耦物体中心世界模型，直接从像素学习物体级潜在表示。

Result: DLPWM在重建和预测方面表现强劲，对多种分布外视觉变化具有鲁棒性，但在模型控制任务中表现不如DreamerV3。

Conclusion: 物体中心感知支持鲁棒的视觉建模，但要实现稳定的控制需要缓解潜在漂移问题。

Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体规划中，MCTS面临组合动作空间指数级增长的问题，导致树扩展的分支因子急剧增加，难以高效进行探索和利用。

Method: 提出MALinZero方法，将联合动作回报投影到低维空间，使用上下文线性赌博机问题，通过凸且μ-平滑的损失函数解决该问题，并推导出线性上置信界应用于树(LinUCT)。

Result: MALinZero在矩阵游戏、SMAC和SMACv2等多智能体基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，优于基于模型和无模型的多智能体强化学习基线，具有更快的学习速度和更好的性能。

Conclusion: MALinZero通过低维表示结构有效解决了多智能体MCTS中的组合动作空间问题，为复杂多智能体规划提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个新的评估框架，使用逻辑网格谜题来系统性地探测LLMs在逻辑推理和决策中受到社会刻板印象的影响程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全护栏能有效抑制明显的偏见输出，但在复杂逻辑推理任务中更微妙的社会偏见会显现，而现有评估基准无法检测这些偏见。

Method: 使用逻辑网格谜题自动生成和验证，创建刻板印象、反刻板印象和中立三种变体，评估多个模型家族在不同谜题复杂度下的表现，并测试基于提示的缓解策略。

Result: 模型在解决方案符合刻板印象关联时推理准确率更高，这表明LLMs在演绎推理中持续存在社会偏见。

Conclusion: PRIME对于诊断和量化LLMs演绎推理中持续存在的社会偏见具有重要意义，特别是在公平性至关重要的场景中。

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

Motivation: 评估和优化大语言模型在链式推理中的推理一致性，解决模型生成推理链与人类参考推理链之间的语义对齐问题。

Method: 提出对齐分数指标量化语义对齐程度，定义四种关键错误类型（逻辑断开、主题转移、冗余推理、因果反转），并开发语义一致性优化采样方法选择对齐错误最少的推理链。

Result: 实证发现2跳推理链对齐分数最高，语义一致性优化采样方法平均提升对齐分数29.84%，在3跳推理任务中效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: 该框架有效评估和优化大语言模型的推理一致性，提出的对齐分数和优化方法能够显著提升模型生成推理链的质量和语义对齐程度。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交推理游戏中玩家隐藏身份并故意误导他人，准确的隐藏角色推断是游戏表现的关键，需要客观分析游戏玩法。

Method: 将游戏事件和对话映射到四个语言无关的约束类别：证据、现象、断言和假设。硬约束修剪不可能的角色分配，加权软约束对剩余分配进行评分，信息增益加权将每个假设与其在熵减少下的期望值联系起来。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，CSP4SDG在所有推理场景中都优于基于LLM的基准，并且作为辅助"推理工具"时能提升LLM性能。

Conclusion: 基于信息理论的原则性概率推理是社交推理游戏中重量级神经模型的可扩展替代或补充方案。

Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

Abstract: The growing demand for AI applications in fields such as materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science has made data preparation an important but labor-intensive step. Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed "From Data to Better Data."

Motivation: 解决复杂任务需要LLMs生成多步推理链，现有验证方法如PRMs计算成本高、领域受限或需要大规模标注数据。

Method: 训练基于transformer的不确定性量化头(UHeads)，利用冻结LLM的内部状态估计推理步骤不确定性，标签由更大LLM或原始模型自监督生成。

Result: UHeads参数少于10M，在数学、规划和常识问答等多个领域，性能匹配或超越比其大810倍的PRMs。

Conclusion: LLM内部状态编码了不确定性信息，可作为可靠的推理验证信号，为可扩展和泛化的自省LLMs提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Result: 在AIME24(80.3 vs 79.8)、AIME25(74.4 vs 70.0)、HMMT25(50.4 vs 41.7)三个数学基准上超越了400倍大的DeepSeek R1；在LiveCodeBench V6上获得51.1分，优于Magistral Medium的50.3分；相比基础模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 小模型通过适当的训练方法可以实现与大型模型相当的推理能力，这大幅降低了AI研究的成本和门槛，为AI民主化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

Conclusion: ROAR模型在真实世界条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，特别是在处理传感器退化、环境噪声和不平衡数据分布方面，为复杂交通环境中的可靠准确事故预测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

Conclusion: GAIA通过协调治理机制和安全不变性，为AI委托提供了理论与实践之间的桥梁，确保在B2B谈判中的安全部署。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Motivation: 现有方法在固定数据集上调整提示，限制了适应新问题类型或文档结构的能力，或者需要昂贵的人工标注数据来构建提示，因此需要一种能够自我改进且无需外部标签的提示优化方法。

Method: 结合合成数据生成器、验证器和提示优化器的闭环框架，生成器产生暴露当前提示弱点的示例，验证器检查生成示例的有效性和鲁棒性，优化器根据结果逐步优化提示。

Result: 在DocMath-Eval基准测试中，该系统在准确性和鲁棒性方面均优于标准提示方法。

Conclusion: 将合成数据生成融入提示学习对金融应用具有重要价值，能够在不依赖外部标签的情况下持续改进提示性能。

Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建开放世界的科学发现环境，让AI智能体能够自主进行科学研究，超越传统的刚性优化范式，实现基于涌现行为的自主科学发现。

Method: 利用扩展上下文窗口，智能体在STATION中自由选择行动，进行长期科学探索，包括阅读同行论文、制定假设、提交代码、执行分析和发布结果，没有中央系统协调。

Result: 实验显示STATION中的AI智能体在数学、计算生物学和机器学习等广泛基准测试中达到新的最先进性能，特别是在圆填充问题上超越AlphaEvolve。涌现出丰富的研究叙事和新的方法，如用于scRNA-seq批次整合的密度自适应算法。

Conclusion: STATION代表了迈向开放世界环境中由涌现行为驱动的自主科学发现的第一步，标志着超越刚性优化的新范式。

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIGN是一个用于从多语言新闻中推断交通事故位置的视觉语言框架，通过结合文本和地图线索来模拟人类空间推理，在孟加拉语新闻数据上表现出优于传统地理编码方法的性能。


<details>

Conclusion: 该框架为数据稀缺地区的自动碰撞映射提供了高精度基础，支持基于证据的道路安全政策制定，并促进了多模态人工智能在交通分析中的更广泛集成。

Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

Motivation: LLMs在复杂领域特定知识的推理任务中，反思阶段无法产生新见解，而是机械重复早期推理步骤，这种现象称为'回声反思'

Result: AEPO在多个基准测试中持续优于主流强化学习方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了LLMs在复杂推理任务中的回声反思问题，通过控制信息流和促进认知多样性提升了推理能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全评估依赖昂贵的尖端模型，限制了可扩展性，需要开发成本效益更高的评估方法。

Method: 采用小型语言模型构建多代理评判框架，包含批评者、辩护者和法官三个角色进行结构化辩论，并构建了包含12,000个对抗交互的HAJailBench基准数据集。

Result: 该框架在HAJailBench上达到了与GPT-4o评判者相当的协议水平，同时显著降低了推理成本，三轮辩论在准确性和效率之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结构化、价值对齐的辩论使小型语言模型能够捕捉越狱攻击的语义细微差别，HAJailBench为可扩展的LLM安全评估提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SofT-GRPO是一种新的策略优化算法，通过将Gumbel噪声注入logits、使用Gumbel-Softmax技术避免软思维标记超出预训练嵌入空间，并利用重参数化技巧来增强LLM的软思维推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软思维推理模式在某些场景下优于传统的离散标记链式思维推理，但将强化学习与软思维模式结合存在挑战，因为难以向软思维标记注入随机性并相应更新策略。

Method: 提出SofT-GRPO算法，注入Gumbel噪声到logits，使用Gumbel-Softmax技术，并利用重参数化技巧进行策略梯度优化。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的LLM上进行实验，SofT-GRPO使软思维LLM在Pass@1上略微优于离散标记GRPO（平均准确率+0.13%），在Pass@32上显著提升（平均准确率+2.19%）。

Conclusion: SofT-GRPO成功解锁了软思维推理的潜力，为软思维模式与强化学习的结合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI数据收集方法主要依赖Common Crawl的网页HTML，难以应用于桌面软件和未收录的新网站，需要快速适应个性化场景的低成本解决方案。

Method: 设计Auto-Explorer自动化数据收集方法，包含简单有效的探索机制，能够自主解析和探索GUI环境；建立UIXplore基准评估探索质量，并利用收集数据微调多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: Auto-Explorer提供了一种低成本、高效的GUI数据收集方案，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，为GUI代理的个性化应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在谄媚行为，倾向于同意用户的错误信念和追随错误信息，这损害了模型可靠性并带来社会风险。现有方法主要关注最终答案的判断和修正，而未能理解谄媚行为在推理过程中的发展。

Method: 提出MONICA框架，包含谄媚监控器和校准器。监控器在响应生成过程中实时监控谄媚漂移分数，校准器在分数超过预设阈值时动态抑制谄媚行为，无需模型生成完整答案。

Result: 在12个数据集和3个大型推理模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法有效减少了中间推理步骤和最终答案中的谄媚行为，获得了稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: MONICA框架通过推理步骤级别的实时监控和校准，成功缓解了大型推理模型的谄媚行为，为提升模型可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法在LLM置信度估计方面存在校准差和过度自信问题，特别是在错误预测上，这影响了模型的安全部署。

Method: 将每个思维链视为高维空间中的向量，提取8个拓扑风险特征来捕捉推理分布的几何结构：紧密一致的簇表示高置信度，分散不一致的路径表示不确定性。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，EDTR比现有方法校准效果提升41%，平均ECE为0.287，综合得分0.672最佳，在AIME上达到完美准确率，GSM8K上ECE为0.107。

Conclusion: 为理解和量化多步LLM推理中的不确定性提供了一个几何框架，在需要校准置信度估计的场景中实现更可靠的部署。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类推理行为，可以有效增强RL代理的系统泛化能力，并为实现通用任务抽象和完全抽象规划指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

TL;DR: GHOST是一个分层框架，用于解决图凸集旅行商问题(GCS-TSP)，通过结合组合路径搜索和凸轨迹优化来找到最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TSP方法不适用于GCS-TSP，因为边成本不是固定的，而是取决于通过每个凸区域的具体轨迹选择。需要新的方法来处理这种轨迹规划问题。

Method: GHOST使用分层框架：高层在GCS诱导的完全图上探索路径，低层通过抽象路径展开算法计算可接受的下界来指导搜索。这些边界提供强大的剪枝能力，避免不必要的凸优化调用。

Result: 实验表明，GHOST比统一的混合整数凸规划基准方法快几个数量级，并且能够处理涉及高阶连续性约束和不完整GCS的复杂轨迹规划问题。

Conclusion: GHOST保证了最优性，并提供了有界次优变体用于时间关键场景，是解决GCS-TSP的有效方法。

Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态AI系统是否具备从视觉模式中抽象符号规则的能力——从有限推断无限。分形提供了理想的测试案例，因为它们通过简单的递归规则生成复杂的自相似模式。

Method: 使用FractalBench基准测试，评估12个经典分形的程序合成能力。模型需要生成可执行的Python代码来重现分形，实现客观评估。

Result: 结果显示出显著差距：76%的生成代码语法有效，但只有4%正确捕捉了数学结构。模型在处理几何变换（如Koch曲线：17-21%）方面表现较好，但在分支递归（如树形分形：<2%）方面失败。

Conclusion: FractalBench揭示了多模态AI在数学抽象能力上的根本差距，提供了一个抗污染的视觉-数学推理诊断工具。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

Result: SRFT模型在询问时更可能坦白隐藏目标细节(F1分数0.98)，而基线模型在相同条件下会说谎(F1分数0)。SRFT模型能恢复28-100%的隐藏目标细节，基线模型和预填充助手攻击则为0%。

Conclusion: SRFT是促进诚实倾向和识别不良对齐AI系统的有前景技术，能有效检测和揭露隐藏的不良目标。

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

Motivation: 解决机器在直觉物理理解方面与人类能力的差距，通过脑启发的计算原则来弥合这一鸿沟。

Method: 提出时空关系神经网络(SRNN)，建立统一的神经表示来处理物体属性、关系和时间线，采用Hebbian "一起激发，一起连接"机制，通过预定义-微调方法而非预训练-微调范式。

Result: 在CLEVRER基准测试中达到有竞争力的性能，揭示了基准偏差，展示了白盒诊断能力。

Conclusion: 证实了将生物智能转化为工程系统用于直觉物理理解的可行性。

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂数学推理任务中存在局限，依赖静态教师模型蒸馏的数据集，缺乏适应新问题和深度泛化的能力。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中表现优异，MathVL-test上超越了领先的开源多模态数学推理模型QVQ。

Conclusion: MathSE框架通过迭代自我进化有效提升了MLLMs的数学推理能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

Conclusion: PRC-Emo框架通过整合提示工程、演示检索和课程学习，显著提升了LLM在对话情感识别任务中的表现。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

Result: 在四个真实世界城市和各种下游任务上的广泛实验表明，UrbanLN具有优越性能。

Conclusion: UrbanLN通过长文本感知和噪声抑制有效改进了城市区域表示学习，在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

TL;DR: RedOne 2.0是一个面向社交网络服务的4B参数大语言模型，采用渐进式RL优先后训练范式，在保持鲁棒性的同时提升领域特定能力，数据效率比传统SFT方法提高一倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络服务具有异构工作负载、快速变化的规范俚语、多语言文化多样性等特点，导致严重的分布偏移。传统监督微调方法在领域内性能提升和领域外鲁棒性之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式训练范式：1)探索性学习建立初始对齐并识别系统弱点；2)针对性微调选择性应用SFT填补诊断出的差距；3)精炼学习重新应用RL以社交网络为中心的信号来巩固改进。

Result: 在4B规模下，相比7B次优基线平均提升2.41分，相比基础模型平均提升8.74分，数据效率比SFT中心方法RedOne提高一倍以上。

Conclusion: RedOne 2.0为社交网络场景下的领域特定LLM建立了具有竞争力的成本效益基线，在不牺牲鲁棒性的前提下推进能力发展。

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

Motivation: 传统可解释AI方法主要关注特征归因或事后解释，需要一种更系统的方法来使AI推理过程透明化和可审计。

Result: 实证评估显示，该系统能够在去中心化治理、系统分析和战略推理等场景中复现人类水平的决策逻辑。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的标准流程为可靠、可解释和可验证的AI辅助决策提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM决策支持系统缺乏透明度和可解释性的问题，开发一个能够生成可审计推理过程、模仿专家工作流程的系统。

Method: 使用模块化LLM代理管道，结合三个框架：Vester敏感性模型（因素集、符号影响矩阵、系统角色、反馈循环）、正规形式博弈（策略、支付矩阵、均衡）和序贯博弈（角色条件代理、树构建、逆向归纳）。LLM组件与确定性分析器配对，生成可追踪的中间产物。

Result: 在真实物流案例中（100次运行），26个因素的平均对齐度为55.5%，运输核心子集为62.9%；角色一致性为57%。LLM评委使用八项标准评分（满分100）与重建的人类基准相当。

Conclusion: 可配置的LLM管道能够以透明、可检查的步骤模仿专家工作流程，为决策支持提供可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

Motivation: 现有的成本语义研究主要关注DL-Lite到ALCO之间的描述逻辑，且所有结果都显示成本语义是难处理的。本文旨在扩展研究范围，涵盖包含逆角色和角色包含的DL-Lite方言，并寻找可能的易处理情况。

Method: 通过分配每个解释基于违反公理和断言权重的成本，考虑所有（或某些）具有最优或有界成本的解释来确定确定和可能查询答案。使用一阶重写技术来分析数据复杂性。

Result: 对于DL-Lite^H_bool本体和固定成本边界，实例查询的确定答案和联合查询的可能答案可以通过一阶重写计算，达到最低可能的数据复杂度(TC_0)。同时强化了几个下界并确定了最优成本确定答案语义的精确复杂度。

Conclusion: 成本语义在特定条件下（DL-Lite^H_bool本体和固定成本边界）可以达到易处理的数据复杂度，这挑战了现有关于成本语义总是难处理的认知，为实际应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

Motivation: 随着数据滥用和伪造风险增加，需要检测时间序列大模型生成的合成数据。现有文本生成检测方法不适用于时间序列数据，因为时间序列具有较低信息密度和平滑概率分布的特点。

Method: 提出收缩假说：模型生成的时间序列在递归预测中会表现出逐渐减小的不确定性。基于此开发了不确定性收缩估计器（UCE），通过聚合连续前缀的不确定性指标来识别TSLM生成的时间序列。

Result: 在32个数据集上的广泛实验表明，UCE始终优于最先进的基线方法，为检测模型生成的时间序列提供了可靠且可推广的解决方案。

Conclusion: 模型生成的时间序列确实表现出不确定性收缩特性，UCE方法能够有效利用这一特性进行检测，为解决时间序列数据伪造问题提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

Result: 在三个垂直领域的防御测试中，MENTOR显著降低了语义攻击成功率，实现了LLMs隐式风险缓解的新水平。元认知评估与人类评估者高度一致，且提供更深入的价值对齐分析。

Conclusion: MENTOR框架通过元认知驱动的自我进化机制，有效解决了LLMs在领域任务中的隐式风险问题，提供了一种持续、可泛化的安全对齐方法。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度显著性图的神经符号方法，用于时间序列分类中的潜在子类发现，通过将多类问题转化为二元分类并利用LLM进行符号近似，在标准数据集上优于仅使用信号的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的神经符号方法成功地将神经网络的可学习性与符号推理相结合，为时间序列数据中的知识发现提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在识别潜在子类方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

Method: 设计了一个基于大语言模型的在线社交网络对话模拟器，支持并行反事实模拟，在保持其他因素不变的情况下研究毒性行为如何受到审核干预的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了OSN代理的心理真实性、社会传染现象的出现，以及个性化审核策略相比标准方法的显著优越效果。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的模拟方法为评估社交网络内容审核策略提供了有效的新途径，个性化审核策略在控制有害内容传播方面表现更佳。

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在ad hoc teamwork中容易收敛到单一行为模式，无法捕捉多模态合作模式，而标准扩散模型缺乏在高度非平稳场景中预测和适应的能力。

Method: 提出PADiff扩散模型，在去噪过程中整合队友的关键预测信息，以捕捉智能体的多模态行为并解锁多样化的合作模式。

Result: 在三个合作环境中的广泛实验表明，PADiff显著优于现有的AHT方法。

Conclusion: PADiff通过整合预测信息的扩散模型成功解决了AHT中的多模态行为适应问题，在非平稳环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

TL;DR: ED2D是一个基于证据的多智能体辩论框架，不仅用于错误信息检测，还旨在纠正用户信念和阻止错误信息传播。它在检测准确性上优于现有基线，但其解释在错误分类时可能强化用户误解。

Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论框架只关注检测准确性，忽视了帮助用户理解事实判断背后的推理过程和培养未来抵御能力的重要性。辩论记录作为透明推理的丰富资源未被充分利用。

Method: 引入ED2D框架，扩展了先前方法，整合了事实证据检索。ED2D不仅作为检测框架，还设计为有说服力的多智能体系统，旨在纠正用户信念和阻止错误信息传播。

Result: ED2D在三个错误信息检测基准测试中优于现有基线。当ED2D生成正确预测时，其辟谣记录表现出与人类专家相当的说服效果；但当错误分类时，其解释可能无意中强化用户的误解，即使与准确的人类解释一起呈现。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了部署多智能体辩论系统进行错误信息干预的潜力和潜在风险。开发了公共社区网站来帮助用户探索ED2D，促进透明度、批判性思维和协作事实核查。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究代理采用单上下文范式，将所有信息积累在单一扩展的上下文窗口中，导致上下文窒息和噪声污染，限制了在长时程任务中的有效性。

Method: 将长时程研究重新表述为具有策略性工作空间重构的马尔可夫决策过程，维护演进报告作为记忆并定期合成见解，开发了效率感知策略优化（EAPO）强化学习框架。

Result: 在六个基准测试中平均提升14.5个百分点，与前沿专有系统的差距缩小，在2048次交互中性能从3.5%提升至42.5%，作为提示策略可将前沿模型性能提升19.2个百分点。

Conclusion: IterResearch是长时程推理的多功能解决方案，既可作为训练代理，也可作为前沿模型的提示范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Motivation: 现有的大多数合成人物角色过于浅显简单，仅包含少量属性，无法反映真实人类身份的丰富复杂性和多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过挖掘数千个真实用户-ChatGPT对话算法构建最大的人类属性分类学；然后从该分类学中逐步采样属性，有条件地生成连贯且真实的人物角色。

Result: 内在评估显示属性多样性提高32%，角色独特性提高44%；外在评估显示GPT-4.1-mini的个性化问答准确率平均提高11.6%，在社交调查中缩小模拟LLM公民与真实人类响应差距31.7%。

Conclusion: DEEPPERSONA为高保真人类模拟和个性化AI研究提供了一个严谨、可扩展且隐私自由的平台。

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.
