This\ntopology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first\ndrives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''\nform, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp\ngrowth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by\nphase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier.

RPO employs an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of\neach label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point\nin the training loss to mitigate noise.

Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral\neconomics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online\non-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what\nthe model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to\njust stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive\nprobability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our\ntheory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental\nto maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by\nselectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,\nrather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would\nallow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing\nperformance.

Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment.

Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance.

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)).

To address this gap, we introduce\nthe LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a\ngenerative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and\narticulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these\nfeatures predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical\ndistributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of\nreasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models\nthink. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in\nmath, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their\nthoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from\nLRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond\nclassification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative\nexplanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link\nthe reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of\nsmaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves\ntheir accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%."}

A significant challenge in this process is\nthe distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the\nevolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static\nheuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to\nadapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMeta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework\nthat dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a\nlightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the\npotential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This\nguides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the\noptimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of\nonline and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench\ndemonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference\noptimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online\nannotation costs."}

However, they often generate clinically unsupported\ndescriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in\nmedical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through\nempirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent\nin radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To\naddress this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free\nand retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical\nsignals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage\ncontrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby\nenhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on\nthree datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves\noverall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR\ndataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to\nstate-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and\ngeneralisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively\nbridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology."}

However, the computational cost of pretraining presents\na significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct\nmultiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments\nduring the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only\ntrain a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works\non data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel\ninvestigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and\nwatermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the\nmodel acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of\nthe ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is\nminimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a\npotential confounder in our approach.

Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time.

These inconsistencies stem from a lack of\ncontrolled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate\nwhen and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional\nmodalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient\nreasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts\nperformance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker\nmodalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward\ncertain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be\nintegrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:\ntask-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly\nexecuted in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces\nbias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode\nfact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)\nrestores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck.

Across\na broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or\nsurpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and\nlistwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection.

Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."}

We\nalso introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state\nmatching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly\nimprove the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference\nperformances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated\nlanguage generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard\ndLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128\nNFEs).

To address these issues, we\npropose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs\ndeployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge\ndistillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our\nexperiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and\nmanually.

For black-box models, we find that reasoning\nexpressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence\ntrajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for\nunsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last\ninput token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems\nlinearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we\npropose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression\nmonitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these\nboundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without\nsacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by\ncutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%."}

However,\nmost existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting\nthe internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning\npotential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that\nLLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of\nthe training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this\nrelationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel\nmetric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by\ndecomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze\nhow well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify\nperformance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we\nintroduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the\nlogical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data\nvolume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's\nlogical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric\nstrategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning\nframework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data\nrather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'\nfull cognitive potential."}

We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language\nmodels, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values\nobtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire\n(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across\na number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully\naddresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions\nwithout requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals\nthat our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in\ndimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional\nscaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence\ncoefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results\ndemonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric\nstructures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach\noffers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while\nmaintaining comparable quality to traditional methods.

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that\ncompositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target\ntask. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,\nrequiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative\nanalysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the\nmodels. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of\nthese findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM\nlearning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,\nthen using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex\nproblems."}

Current\nconversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human\nfeedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human\nInteraction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user\nconversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided\nRewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'\nnatural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which\nlearns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term\ninteraction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term\nuser personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference\noptimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI\nvariants outperform strong baselines in personalization and\ninstruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning\nbenchmarks.

A key\nlimitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction\nhistory, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We\npropose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable\nreasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed\nexperiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from\nReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,\nenabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful\nexperience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling\n(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up\nthe agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,\nthe agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive\nsignals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn\nguides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory\nand test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,\nReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store\nraw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness\nand efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish\nmemory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to\nself-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise."}
