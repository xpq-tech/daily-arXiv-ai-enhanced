We investigate this gap with an\nextensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:\n\\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.\nWhen afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy\noptimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the\npolicy to degenerate to a direct \\texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome\nholds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in\nformat is persistent even when the complex \\texttt{<think><answer>} format is\nassigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a\nseries of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear\nhierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,\na preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or\nstrong incentives for more complex behaviors.

While\nprior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human\nreadability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the\nlinguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's\nsusceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary\nline of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the\nsocial sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment\nconstraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we\nhypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,\nmay respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.\nFurthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive\nfingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses.

We demonstrate that the\nlog-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful\nsignal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our\nexperiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and\nreasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors\nform distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a\nlightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a\nresponse will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,\nincluding user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,\ncomputationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early\ntermination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant\nsavings in computational cost.

Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes.

This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of\nHuman AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of\nreliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty\nQuantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human\nexpert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,\nensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,\nenabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population\nlevel, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an\nintuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a\nclassical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop\npractical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution\nfree finite sample guarantees.

LoRA essentially describes the\nprojection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the\ndimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens\nshare the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This\nlimits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent\nsemantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose\nToken-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts\nLoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise\ninput-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of\nTopLoRA can be expressed as $B\\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank\nmatrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated\nfrom each input token $X$.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays.

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

Submitted September 04, 2025", "summary": "Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,\noptimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and\ncultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic\nsources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a\nproprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works\nin linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside\nthousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned\nthrough a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the\nmeaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across\nclassical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on\ncomprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant\nresponses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that\noften fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen\nuses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its\ncore innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the\n\"Utility Gap Crisis\" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'\ncore needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By\nprioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an\ninformation repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.\nThe model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with\nmulti-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both\ncultural preservation and general knowledge domains."}

These structures are stable across depth\nand generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.\nCross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,\nindicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion\nperception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned\nintervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across\nlanguages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective\ngeometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process\nemotion."}

This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious\nlanguage appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological\napproach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms\nderived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating\nin a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we\ncompare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of\nagreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method\nconsistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings\nhighlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting\nreligious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language\nshould be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study\ncontributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the\npotential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred\npersists in climate discourse."}

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

To address the above\nchallenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward\nmodeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:\nWe introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form\npreferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,\nvideo, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal\npreference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K\ninstruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We\npropose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative\nRMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other\nwidely used reward modeling benchmarks."}

This\nvisual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content\ngeneration and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,\nprogress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,\na bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To\naddress these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling\nperspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages\nreciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a\nlarge-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex\ninteractive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we\nconstruct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This\npowers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish\na visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,\nvisual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from\nexisting approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale\nmodels approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.\nFurthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing\nprogrammatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will\nare available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder."}

Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while\nresearch on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this\npaper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to\ncommunicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after\nlong sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to\noutputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source\nagentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at\nhigh confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based\non this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use\nconfidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again\nuntil reaching a satisfactory confidence level.

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

However, their length,\nfinancial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.\nPrior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive\nlabeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial\ntargets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for\nstance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per\nshare (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual\nreports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using\nthe advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this\ncorpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models\n(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\nstrategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best\ncompared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC\nand ECT datasets.
