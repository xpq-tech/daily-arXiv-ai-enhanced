We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test.

To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT.

Once the run length exhibits a\nsharp increase and exceeds a minimum threshold, the generation is terminated.\nWe provide both empirical and theoretical support for this heuristic: step\nanswers steadily converge to the final answer, and large run-length jumps\nreliably mark this convergence. Experiments on five reasoning datasets across\nthree LLMs show that ES-CoT reduces the number of inference tokens by about\n41\\% on average while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard CoT. Further,\nES-CoT integrates seamlessly with self-consistency prompting and remains robust\nacross hyperparameter choices, highlighting it as a practical and effective\napproach for efficient reasoning."}

Through a held-out test\nsplit and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data\ncuration and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance\ncomparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual\naccuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs\nthan the larger counterparts."}

Using open-weight LLMs, we annotate each\nstatement with high-level stances toward migrants and track the net tone toward\nmigrants across time and political parties. For the UK, we extend this with a\nsemi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames to\ncapture nuances of migration discourse. Our findings show that, while US\ndiscourse has grown increasingly polarised, UK parliamentary attitudes remain\nrelatively aligned across parties, with a persistent ideological gap between\nLabour and the Conservatives, reaching its most negative level in 2025. The\nanalysis of narrative frames in the UK parliamentary statements reveals a shift\ntoward securitised narratives such as border control and illegal immigration,\nwhile longer-term integration-oriented frames such as social integration have\ndeclined. Moreover, discussions of national law about immigration have been\nreplaced over time by international law and human rights, revealing nuances in\ndiscourse trends. Taken together broadly, our findings demonstrate how LLMs can\nsupport scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical\ncontexts."}

In this work, we present a systematic\ncomparison of \"thinking\" and \"non-thinking\" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm\nusing open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B\nparameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on\nRewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking\nmodels, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based\nevaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these\nenhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking\ncounterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%\npoints higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to\naugmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a\nhigher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that\nthinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of\nbias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random\nbiases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the\nmultilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends\nits benefits beyond English.

In this paper, we present a\nnovel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs'\nsymbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our\napproach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action\napplicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical\ninference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through\nthe precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied\nin a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes\nthrough structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification\nskills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about\nprecondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation.\nExperimental results on multiple planning domains show that our\nchain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly\nbetter at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard\nbenchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This\nwork bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the\nlogical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising\ndirection for developing better AI planning systems."}

Integrating external\ntools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent\nadvances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing\ntool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and\nenhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This\nis motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call\nis a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR\nincorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback\nto dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple\nmathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code\nbenchmarks.

More recently it\nhas been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major\ntransitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,\nfundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of\ninformation flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether\nchanges in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in\ncognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and\nlaminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars\nthat differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We\ndocumented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent\nnetworks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related\nqualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We\nalso noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of\ntransition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of\nevolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a\nperformance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform\nnon-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some\nchanges in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance."}
