This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\u53ca\u5176\u7f16\u8f91\u7248\u672cMing-UniAudio-Edit\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\u53ca\u5176\u7f16\u8f91\u7248\u672cMing-UniAudio-Edit\u3002", "result": "\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c8/12\u6307\u6807\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1b\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686Seed-TTS-WER\u4e3a0.95\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb(CIA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684LLMs\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb(CIA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7247\u6bb5\u523b\u610f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50LLMs\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(Mismatched SFT)\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCIA\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u9010\u5b57\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9010\u5b57\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5404\u79cdLLMs\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests.

Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones.

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models.

Calmon"], "title": "Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability", "comment": "23 Pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u4eff\u8fd8\u662f\u6df1\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001Shapley\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800cGPT-2\u3001Falcon-RW-1B\u548cGPT-Neo-125M\u7b49\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

We present \\texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLEAP\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba9\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u4f18\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLEAP\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "LEAP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply.

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors.

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hapax\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u51cf\u5c11\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f53\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u65f6\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u662f\u5426\u662f\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHapax\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7701\u7565\u80fd\u88ab\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba131.7%\u7684token\u88ab\u4ece\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u7701\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u572821\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u768413\u4e2a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u503c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks.

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f16\u8f91\u4f1a\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8870\u51cf\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u79fb\u9664\u9690\u853d\u6216\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u62a4\u6709\u76ca\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5c06\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5982\u679c\u7f16\u8f91\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MEMIT\u3001AlphaEdit\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u3001LoRA\u3001DoRA\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5171232\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAlphaEdit\u7f16\u8f91\u6bd4MEMIT\u7f16\u8f91\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5408\u6210\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f20\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u8d1f\u8d23\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u4ee3\u7406\u8d1f\u8d23\u6536\u655b\u5408\u6210\uff1bCLPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u7406\u7531\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e05\u6d01\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro+CLPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLPWM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982DreamerV3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DLPWM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u50cf\u7d20\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "DLPWM\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982DreamerV3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u89e3\u6f5c\u5728\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86RL\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22RL\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83SFT\u548cRL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u5728MedConceptsQA\u4e0a\u5c0624pp\u964d\u81f37pp\uff09\uff1bRL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aRL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u65b9\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6539\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aRL\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies.

However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u4f18\u52bftoken\u662f\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u71b5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6b21\u4f18\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9RLVR\u4e2d\u71b5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u4f18\u52bftoken\u662f\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5f71\u54cdRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5UHeads\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578bPRMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981LLMs\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982PRMs\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934(UHeads)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u7531\u66f4\u5927LLM\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "UHeads\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e10M\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6bd4\u5176\u5927810\u500d\u7684PRMs\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7701LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The system requires only 1.87M trainable parameters (1.37% of full fine-tuning) and trains in approximately 2 hours on a single T4 GPU, making robust hate speech detection accessible in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRA\u8c03\u4f18BERTweet\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRA\u8c03\u4f18BERTweet\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8fbe\u52300.85\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u768494%\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f100\u500d\uff081.34\u4ebfvs140\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3002\u4ec5\u9700187\u4e07\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u76841.37%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2aT4 GPU\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea62\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReMoD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7531\u4e8e\u7c97\u7cd9\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u7acb\u573a\u8bef\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReMoD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u521d\u59cb\u7acb\u573a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u7cbe\u70bc\u7acb\u573a\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171MMSD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReMoD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ReMoD\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.).

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict \"trustworthy-before-helpful\" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions.

This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u8ffd\u968f\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMONICA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8c04\u5a9a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u8c04\u5a9a\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TimeSense\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728EvalTS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimeSense\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "TimeSense\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeSense\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\uff1bSkipper\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation.

In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios.

We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction.

GitHub: https://github.com/czi-ai/DrugMechCounterfactuals", "summary": "Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0o4-mini\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cQwen3-4B-thinking\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8ao4-mini\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "o4-mini\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cQwen3-4B-thinking\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8ao4-mini\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5185\u90e8\u73af\u8282\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u5f71\u54cd\u836f\u7269\u73af\u8282\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5982Qwen3-4B-thinking\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph.

We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL.

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8be2\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf4\u8c0e\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u9690\u853d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0b\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "SRFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282(F1\u5206\u65700.98)\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8c0e(F1\u5206\u65700)\u3002SRFT\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6062\u590d28-100%\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a9\u624b\u653b\u51fb\u5219\u4e3a0%\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFT\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bda\u5b9e\u503e\u5411\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u826f\u5bf9\u9f50AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63ed\u9732\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models.

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English.

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u6216\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u597d\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u751a\u81f3\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u667a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5TAQ\u548cTAQO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u4ed6\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TAQ\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0cTAQO\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4ece\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cTAQ\u548cTAQO\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002TAQ\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cTAQO\u5728Llama-3.1\u3001Qwen3\u548cQwen2.5\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523042.33 EM/50.81 F1\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85AWQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Teaching Emotion Recognition with Prompts, Retrieval, and Curriculum Learning", "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions.

In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset.

The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "RedOne 2.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u670d\u52a1\u76844B\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fRL\u4f18\u5148\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u670d\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u4fda\u8bed\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1)\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f31\u70b9\uff1b2)\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e94\u7528SFT\u586b\u8865\u8bca\u65ad\u51fa\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b3)\u7cbe\u70bc\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u65b0\u5e94\u7528RL\u4ee5\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5de9\u56fa\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u57284B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd47B\u6b21\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.41\u5206\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.74\u5206\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6bd4SFT\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5RedOne\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "RedOne 2.0\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aLLM\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63a8\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u591a\u5c42\u6620\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4fee\u8f9e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fee\u8f9e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u975e\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5206\u88c2-\u8054\u5408\u3001\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u3001\u6269\u5c55-\u7f29\u51cf\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5bf9\u5076\uff09\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u591a\u5c42\u6620\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u4ece\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u518d\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\uff09\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9879\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fb9\u9645\u4fee\u8f9e\u6bd4\u7279\uff08MRB\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u4fee\u8f9e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8DL-Lite\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6613\u5904\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u67d0\u4e9b\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6(TC_0)\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08DL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6613\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u603b\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination.

We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes.

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u53cd\u601d\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6811\uff1b3. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMENTOR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLMs\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCMM\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528H\u00e1jek-MoE\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LLM\u84b8\u998f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faCMM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026LLM\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528H\u00e1jek-MoE\u5728\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "CMM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8623\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff082.7\u4ebf\u523040\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u6062\u590d\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf23\u4e2aSLM\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u53d8\u6362\u572825%\u300150%\u300175%\u548c100%\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u6062\u590d\u529b\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0'\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6c61\u67d3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps.

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeNlidb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684NLIDB\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728NLIDB\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168SQL\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u8bbe\u5b9a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM-based NLIDB\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates.

Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position.

To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations.

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b(NER)\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728NER\u4e2d\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e92\u65a5\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u88ab\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u5c5e\u6027\u626e\u6f14\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b(\u5982\u4eba\u7269\u3001\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7)\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aNER\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u96c6\u5408\uff1b3) \u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bcd\u8bed\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b4) \u63a2\u7d22\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bcd\u8bed\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587(\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u6587\u6863)\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7NER\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RPTS\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548cRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u6811\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u914d\u52a0\u6743\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6784\u5efaRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b374\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c390\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u7684\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LVLMs\uff08\u5982GPT4o\u3001Llava-Next\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u5546\u4e1aLVLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment.

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters.

Code and interactive demo available", "summary": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.\n  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aprobe prompting\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7ea6\u97002\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u79cd\u5b50\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807logit\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u5bfc\u5411\u4f46\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6309\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u548cSay-X\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cprobe-prompted\u5b50\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u60270.83\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5ea60.54\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ec4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u5cf0\u503c\u6807\u8bb0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad82.3\u500d\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad85.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u4ea4\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7a33\u5065\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0864%\u8f6c\u79fb\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u665a\u671f\u5c42Say-X\u7279\u5f81\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u4fc3\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72-\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \\textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin.

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.\n  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed-\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98-\u7ea0\u6b63\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5bf9IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u5e73\u574717.1%\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea0\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982\u82f1\u8bed-\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ece42.00\u63d0\u5347\u523043.30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed-\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u590d\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u8377\u5170\u548c\u897f\u73ed\u7259586\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76845,836\u6761\u5f55\u97f3\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0eMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2dMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e7\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff1b\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u8bcd\u6570\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u9891\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics.

However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u5f31\u70b9\u503c(MIWV)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4ec51%\u7684\u9ad8MIWV\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9aLLM\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u65f6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u91cf\u5316MIWV\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9009\u62e9MIWV\u6392\u540d\u524d1%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "conclusion": "MIWV\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e"}}

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EBM-CoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u7684token\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u8fbe\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5411\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "EBM-CoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals.

Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision.

Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present.

As part of the \"Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification\" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team \"Retriv\" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C).

While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents.

RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques.

In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs.

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLLMs\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7c7bNTK\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NTK-Selector\u9009\u62e9\u76849,000\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6837\u672c\u4f7fLlama3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-8B\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97+8.7\u548c+5.1\u5206\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281,000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6837\u672c\u768410.9\u500d\u548c5.7\u500d\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team \"Retriv\" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934.

The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5bfc\u5411\u624b\u672f\u534f\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0SAOP\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u547d\u4ee4\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u64cd\u4f5cCT\u626b\u63cf\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u624b\u773c\u5b8c\u5168\u6295\u5165\u624b\u672f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4e2d\u65ad\u624b\u672f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5bfc\u5411\u624b\u672f\u534f\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u7531LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u97f3\u547d\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "SAOP\u5728240\u4e2a\u8bed\u97f3\u547d\u4ee4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0cLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u5fae\u521b\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We propose conversational infill, a task where a lightweight on-device model generates contextually appropriate dialogue while seamlessly incorporating streaming knowledge from a powerful backend model. This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e91\u7aef\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u5feb\u4f46\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u586b\u5145\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3360M\u53c2\u6570\u7684ConvFill\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u8bdd\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "ConvFill\u76f8\u6bd4\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u72ec\u7acb\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534736-42%\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f4e\u4e8e200ms", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u53c8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406"}}

Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78.
