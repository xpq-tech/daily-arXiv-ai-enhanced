Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good\nsentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve\ninternational issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional\nmethods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual\ncontent analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nlack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework\nthat identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift\npublic sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a\nlanguage model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this\nend, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and\ntheir associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories\nand in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual\nfeatures for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's\nnarrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual\ngeneration algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically\nproduce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this\nframework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with\na 70\\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for\ndiplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven\ninsights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a\nmore desirable public sentiment."}

The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM\nevaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;\nReference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from\nthe original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the\nreference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive\nEvaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each\nquestion. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human\nevaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and\nscore Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the\nlowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square\ndeviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation\noffers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other\nmethods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results\nin concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to\ncorrectly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good\nresults due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that\nArtificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper\nmethodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic\nresources."}

Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding\nmodels and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no\nsingle approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while\nstate-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate\nin aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical\nmetric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on\ninformation sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of\n0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794.

When a homonym appears in a prompt,\ndiffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which\nis known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an\nAnglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the\ntext-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous\nin the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after\ntranslation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring\nduplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using\nboth automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human\nevaluation.

On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream\ngenerative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating\nsubtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the\nperspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient\nexternality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and\nsystematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an\nLLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other\ncultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000\ngeneration prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through\nthe lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an\nLLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10\ndiverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a\nstark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of\nUS-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider\nstances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2\ninference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness\nIntervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness\nAgents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)\nintroduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.\n(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized\nagents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates\ninitial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates\nfeedback to produce a polished, unbiased script).

We address these challenges with a unified framework\nthat combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its\nfoundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,\nintegrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of\nthis substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates\neach candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware\nIterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality.

We argue that these issues come from\ninformation loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during\npairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that\naddresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)\ndistribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from\ndiscrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise\nscoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity\nviolations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also\nformalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and\ndemonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces\nScore-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise\nTransitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining\nhigher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of\nevaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.\nThe framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model\narchitectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without\nrequiring additional training or human annotations.

Incorporating long\nchain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to\nsubstantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often\nutilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which\ndata types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this\npaper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time\nas the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly\nanswer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model\nperformance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value\nreasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract\natomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and\ninductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched\nwith valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity\nalgorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently\nselecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the\ncore set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only\n10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve\nby 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of\ndownstream RL performance by 7.81%."}
