### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于信息状态方法的任务导向对话管理模型，通过构建中间信息组件和有限信息状态来增强目标感知规划能力，并利用LLM的上下文学习实现，在MultiWOZ数据集上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向对话系统大多围绕大语言模型构建，但忽视了有效的目标感知规划，而主动规划对于任务完成至关重要。

Method: 创建基于信息状态方法的对话管理模型，构建预定义槽位和文本部分信息组件来建模用户偏好，识别关键情境并创建对应信息组件，通过有限信息状态和对话移动实现状态转换，利用LLM的上下文学习实现数据库查询和实体排序。

Result: 在MultiWOZ单领域完整测试对话评估中，实现了最高的信息提供率和成功率，相比之前方法有所提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于信息状态和中间信息构建的对话管理模型能够有效增强目标感知规划能力，在任务导向对话系统中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于监督学习的古吉拉特语机器翻译评估指标，使用25个特征训练了两个模型版本，在1000个MT系统输出上测试显示优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估方法对英语和欧洲语言有效，但不适用于印度语言，因此需要为古吉拉特语开发专门的评估指标。

Method: 使用监督学习方法，基于25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6隐藏层和10隐藏层，各500轮训练），在7个MT系统的1000个输出上与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标在人类相关性方面优于其他可用指标，显示出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的基于监督学习的古吉拉特语MT评估指标有效解决了印度语言MT评估的特殊需求，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将LLM的"幻觉"重新定义为泛化问题的表现，指出在封闭世界假设下可缓解幻觉，但在开放世界假设下幻觉不可避免，建议将其视为需要容忍的结构性特征而非工程缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的工程缺陷，要么认为其理论不可避免，但都未充分考虑AGI所需的条件。论文旨在从泛化问题的角度重新理解幻觉现象。

Method: 通过区分封闭世界和开放世界假设，开发幻觉分类方法，识别可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型，并分析其在AGI背景下的意义。

Result: 建立了幻觉的分类框架，证明在开放世界条件下某些幻觉是结构性的、不可避免的，需要被容忍而非完全消除。

Conclusion: 幻觉不应仅仅被视为工程缺陷，而应作为与人类智能兼容的结构性特征来处理，特别是在追求AGI的开放世界环境中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

### [4] [Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121)
*Durgesh Nandini,Rebekka Koch,Mirco Schoenfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了使用大型语言模型从经济学文本中提取结构化知识三元组的有效性，特别关注零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LLMs在经济学领域结构化知识提取中的有效性，特别是从贸易协定文本中创建经济贸易知识图谱。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1模型处理非结构化区域贸易协定文本，应用零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术（包含正负示例）来提取三元组。

Result: 通过定量和定性指标评估了不同提示技术的性能，讨论了关键见解、挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 强调了语言模型在经济学应用中的重要性，展示了从法律贸易协定文本中提取结构化知识的可行性。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE框架通过强化认知推理来提升情感支持对话的质量，不依赖大规模合成数据，使用强化学习优化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据增强和合成语料构建，但忽视了支撑有效情感支持的深层认知推理过程。

Method: 利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯的支持性回复，并采用强化学习来细化和强化推理过程。

Result: CARE显著提升了回复的逻辑合理性和支持质量。

Conclusion: 该框架推动了具有同理心、认知鲁棒性和类人特性的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS是一个通过多智能体自博弈生成有说服力多轮对话的可扩展框架，包含用户代理、对话代理和优化代理，无需人工标注即可生成训练数据，在营销场景中将小模型的有机流量转化率提升了22.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，实现低成本训练数据生成。

Method: 使用三个协调的智能体：模拟多样化人物行为的用户代理、执行任务导向说服策略的对话代理、评估和优化对话结果的优化代理，并通过用户态度链建模和专用LLM说服力评估验证有效性。

Result: 在真实营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小LLM的说服能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效解决数据稀缺问题，提升模型说服能力，具有明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDIOMoE模型通过将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的原生方言，使用混合专家架构分离文本和物品专家，解决了协同过滤和LLM在推荐系统中的融合难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，但协同信号语义不透明而LLM难以建模隐式用户偏好，需要统一方法。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络拆分为文本专家和物品专家，使用token类型门控避免模态间干扰，将物品交互历史作为语言处理。

Result: 在公开和专有数据集上都表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功实现了协同信号和自然语言在语言空间中的统一处理，为推荐系统提供了有效的多模态融合方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改进大语言模型的不确定性表达能力，提升校准度和区分度，但不同元认知任务需要多任务训练才能获得泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在决策场景中应用越来越多，但它们在表达低置信度时信号不足，用户可能会在不知情的情况下基于错误输出采取行动。虽然LLMs内部保持不确定性信号，但其显性表达的置信度通常校准不佳，难以区分正确和错误答案。

Method: 在两种类型的LLMs上进行监督微调，使用涵盖常识、数学和开放式知识的数据集，评估两种元认知任务：单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较，并评估在医学和法律推理等未见领域的泛化能力。

Result: 微调提高了校准度（陈述置信度与准确性之间的对齐）和区分度（正确与错误回答的置信度差异），同时保持准确性不变。但改进是任务特定的：单问题校准训练不能转移到成对比较，反之亦然。多任务微调在跨域评估中产生更广泛的增益。

Conclusion: LLMs的不确定性表达是可训练和可泛化的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然相互强化，必须通过多任务训练共同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

### [9] [Advancing Automated Spatio-Semantic Analysis in Picture Description Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05128)
*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化流程，用于从图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIU)，以评估认知语言障碍，相比传统方法更高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有认知障碍自动评估方法常忽略视觉叙事路径（描述图片元素的顺序和位置），而手动标记或基于词典的方法效率低下。

Method: 使用基于BERT的流程，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，自动从Cookie Theft图片描述中提取和排序CIU。

Result: 5折交叉验证显示：CIU检测中位精度93%，中位召回率96%，序列错误率24%；提取的特征与真实值强相关，优于词典基线；特征性能与人工标注相当。

Conclusion: 该流程能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

### [10] [Automated Alignment of Math Items to Content Standards in Large-Scale Assessments Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05129)
*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种自动化方法用于项目与内容标准的对齐，包括基于嵌入的机器学习模型、BERT模型微调和集成学习。DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中表现最佳，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模评估中，项目与内容标准的准确对齐对于有效的分数解释至关重要。

Method: 1. 提取嵌入并训练经典监督机器学习模型；2. 微调八个BERT模型及其变体；3. 探索多数投票和堆叠的集成学习方法。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未超过最佳语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化项目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，语言模型在性能上优于传统方法和集成学习。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [11] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sub-CP框架，通过子模块目标控制块多样性来解决上下文学习中信息冗余或不足表示的问题，提升少样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效上下文学习方法在处理分块时忽略信息冗余或不足表示问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用子模块目标控制块多样性的块感知上下文选择框架，支持从全局多样到局部一致的灵活选择策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP框架通过精细控制语义结构，有效解决了上下文学习中的块选择问题。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

### [12] [Rationale-Augmented Retrieval with Constrained LLM Re-Ranking for Task Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05131)
*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合语义搜索系统，结合了轻量级拼写容错检索、嵌入向量相似性和受限LLM重排序，解决Head Start项目中工作人员在GoEngage平台上查找任务的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目工作人员在GoEngage平台上难以找到合适的任务模块，原因包括领域特定术语、系统特定命名以及词汇搜索在处理拼写错误和词序变化方面的局限性。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法，结合拼写容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似性和受限LLM重排序，利用现有任务库和知识库基础设施，通过智能缓存、短列表生成和优雅降级机制确保经济高效。

Result: 提供了完整的实施框架，包括所需资源、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议（使用Hit@K、Precision@K、Recall@K、MRR指标）和在线测量方法（查询成功率、零结果率、停留时间代理指标）。

Conclusion: 该混合搜索系统能够有效解决任务查找问题，同时确保可信度、可演进性和经济效率，为Head Start项目提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [13] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在SFT中引入基于集合的全局损失，以解决传统方法在多样性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通过扩展并行测试时计算来提升性能，但这依赖于生成既多样又准确的推理路径。对于复杂问题，触发多样且正确推理模式的分支标记通常位于采样树深处，传统方法如温度缩放面临多样性与准确性权衡恶化的挑战。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在SFT中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配将全局分支标记与独特推理轨迹进行匹配，提出SSFT方法。

Result: SSFT在多个推理基准测试中，在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下始终优于标准SFT，能够保留独特推理模式并产生新兴的全局分支标记。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了并行推理中多样性与准确性的权衡问题，相比传统SFT方法具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

### [14] [Characterizing Model Behavior Under Synthetic Data Training: An Empirical Study Across Scales and Mixing Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05133)
*Y. Du,G. Wu,G. Tang,W. Wang,Q. Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过控制实验研究了合成数据比例对模型性能的影响，发现20%以下合成数据能保持稳定性能，30%以上性能加速下降，大模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性，校准退化先于准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然合成数据在现代NLP训练中应用广泛，但缺乏对合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型行为的系统性理解。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个多样化任务上进行控制实验，评估1-3次训练迭代中合成数据比例从0-50%的影响。

Result: 模型在20%合成数据下保持稳定性能，超过30%性能加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持80%以上外部数据）处于安全范围内，为从业者提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

*Luka Terčon,Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇综述论文系统梳理了AI生成文本的语言特征研究现状，发现AI文本通常更正式、非个人化，词汇多样性较低，且当前研究主要集中在英语和GPT模型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，需要系统研究AI生成文本的语言特征，但目前缺乏对现有研究成果的综合分析。

Method: 通过多维分类框架（语言描述层次、模型类型、文本体裁、语言种类、提示方法）对现有研究进行系统性梳理和综合。

Result: AI生成文本倾向于使用更正式、非个人化的风格，名词、限定词和介词使用更多，形容词和副词较少；词汇多样性较低，词汇量较小，文本重复性较高。

Conclusion: 当前研究存在英语数据和GPT模型集中的局限性，需要更多跨语言、跨模型的研究，并应关注提示敏感性对文本生成的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDetective是一个针对多跳深度搜索任务的基准测试，通过无提示问题和受控维基百科沙盒确保模型行为可追溯，并提供分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：基准测试在问题文本中泄露推理路径，以及评估简化为单一通过率，掩盖了失败的具体原因。

Method: 开发WebDetective基准测试，包含无提示多跳问题和受控维基百科沙盒，确保模型行为完全可追溯；建立分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的整体评估框架。

Result: 评估25个最先进模型显示系统性弱点：模型在拥有足够证据时仍难以有效利用知识，在缺乏证据时几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式暴露了当前系统擅长执行给定推理路径但无法自主发现的根本差距。

Conclusion: WebDetective的诊断框架可以指导具体的架构改进，开发了EvidenceLoop代理工作流程，通过验证循环和系统证据跟踪改善搜索和合成能力，为开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理提供了关键工具。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA是一个多智能体协作工作流，模拟人类文献综述过程，通过专门智能体进行内容提纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅，生成连贯全面的综述文章。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长使得保持文献综述的全面性和时效性变得困难，现有研究主要关注自动检索和筛选，而综述写作阶段特别是可读性和事实准确性方面仍待探索。

Method: 采用多智能体协作工作流，包含内容提纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等专门智能体，在SciReviewGen和ScienceDirect数据集上进行评估。

Result: LiRA在写作和引用质量上优于AutoSurvey和MASS-Survey等基线方法，同时保持与人工撰写综述的竞争力，在真实场景文档检索中也表现良好。

Conclusion: 即使没有领域特定调优，智能体化LLM工作流也能提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NLD-LLM框架，用于评估语言模型生成源代码描述的能力，发现精心设计的提示工程能让较小模型表现竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估语言模型在自然语言描述任务中的表现，特别是生成准确简洁的源代码描述。

Method: 使用多种transformer模型（Qwen、DeepSeek、Phi、LLaMA、Mistral），采用综合提示设计策略和迭代优化过程，通过语义和结构指标进行评估。

Result: 提示工程显著影响模型效果，精心设计的提示能让较小模型表现竞争力。

Conclusion: NLD-LLM框架为评估语言模型的自然语言描述能力提供了系统方法，强调了提示工程的重要性。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

### [20] [To model human linguistic prediction, make LLMs less superhuman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05141)
*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测下一个词方面表现优于人类，但作为人类语言理解认知模型时却不如人类，这是因为它们拥有超人的长短期记忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为人类语言预测认知模型的有效性，并解释为什么随着模型预测能力的提升，它们对人类阅读行为的预测能力反而下降。

Method: 分析LLMs与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别导致LLMs'超人表现'的两个关键因素：超强的长短期记忆能力。

Result: 发现LLMs由于拥有远超人类的长短期记忆能力，能够比人类更好地预测下一个词，但这导致它们低估了人类阅读时的处理难度。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类水平长短期记忆能力的模型，并指出当前人类数据不足以衡量这一目标的进展，建议进行新的人类实验来填补这一空白。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取管道，从实验报告中捕获47个材料特征，涵盖成分、加工、微观结构和性能，显著提高提取精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料数据提取方法通常只关注有限特征，未能整合成分-加工-微观结构-性能关系，难以构建全面数据库。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取管道，集成迭代提取和来源追踪，使用大语言模型从实验报告中提取47个材料特征。

Result: 特征级和元组级F1分数均达到约0.96，微观结构类别F1分数提升10.0%-13.7%，遗漏材料从49个减少到13个（遗漏率从12.4%降至3.3%）。

Conclusion: 该管道实现了可扩展的文献挖掘，生成高精度、低遗漏、零误报的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可靠输入。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

TL;DR: 提出了SynCED-EnDe数据集，用于机器翻译中的关键错误检测，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个白银标注的句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，相比WMT21数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面都有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMT21英德关键错误检测数据集存在规模小、标签不平衡、领域覆盖有限和时间陈旧等问题，需要新的资源来推动机器翻译安全部署。

Method: 构建了SynCED-EnDe数据集，从2024-2025年的多样化来源（StackExchange、GOV.UK）收集数据，引入明确的错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 使用XLM-R和相关编码器的基准实验显示，由于平衡标签和精细化标注，相比WMT21数据集获得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe可作为社区资源，推动机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手等应用中的安全部署，特别是在可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景中。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）解码轨迹的模型归属方法，通过提取有向解码图（DDM）结构信息，并使用高斯轨迹归属（GTA）进行模型识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs的双向解码机制不仅提升了模型性能，还可以作为模型归属的强大工具。挑战在于不同归属场景的多样性，包括区分不同模型以及同一模型的不同检查点。

Method: 提出有向解码图（DDM）来捕捉解码步骤间的结构关系，避免直接使用模型置信度的冗余问题。然后使用高斯轨迹归属（GTA），为每个目标模型的每个解码位置拟合单元高斯分布，通过轨迹的似然度进行归属评分。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确识别模型归属。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹可以作为模型归属的可靠特征，DDM和GTA方法在不同归属场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 提出了时序思维机制，一种用于全双工语音对话模型的实时思考方法，在倾听用户语音时进行增量推理，提高响应质量而不增加延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工系统在倾听阶段只是重复预测静音标记，这与人类在对话中进行轻量思考的行为不符，需要更自然的交互机制。

Method: 时序思维机制：严格因果推理（仅基于过去音频增量更新假设）和无额外延迟（在倾听窗口内分摊推理，用户停止说话后立即响应）。

Result: 通过客观指标和人工评估均显示响应质量持续提升，同时能稳健处理对话动态并在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 时序思维为全双工语音对话模型提供了有效的实时思考机制，显著改善响应质量并保持低延迟特性。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 认识到金融应用对准确性、可靠性和领域适应的关键需求，探索金融LLMs如何有效设计和评估以辅助金融决策过程。

Method: 分析FinMA的模型架构，使用金融指令调优(FIT)数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下进行评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对金融LLMs如何有效设计和评估的理解，以辅助金融相关决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large
Language Models (LLMs) in the context of financial natural language processing
(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial
tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain
adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在大型语言模型评估中，示例之间的分隔符选择（如逗号、换行、分号等）会显著影响模型性能，MMLU任务中性能差异可达±23%，甚至可以通过改变分隔符来操纵模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM评估中示例分隔符选择对模型性能的影响，因为虽然示例数量已被标准化研究，但分隔符格式选择却较少被关注。

Method: 通过在不同模型家族（Llama、Qwen、Gemma）上测试多种分隔符，分析MMLU等任务性能变化，并探究注意力机制来解释性能差异。

Result: 分隔符选择对模型性能有显著影响，性能差异可达±23%，可以通过改变单个分隔符字符来操纵模型排名，这种脆弱性在不同主题和模型家族中普遍存在且不随规模增大而改善。

Conclusion: LLM对分隔符选择具有脆弱性，在提示中明确指定分隔符可以提高鲁棒性，论文提供了最佳分隔符选择的实用建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

TL;DR: 提出了DeliberationBank数据集和DeliberationJudge模型，用于评估大规模公共审议的AI摘要系统，解决LLM在审议摘要中存在的少数观点代表性不足和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模公共审议产生大量自由形式贡献，需要生成具有代表性和中立性的政策摘要。LLM虽然有望用于此类摘要生成，但存在少数观点代表性不足和输入顺序偏见等公平性问题，需要大规模评估方法。

Method: 构建DeliberationBank数据集，包含10个审议问题的3000名参与者意见数据，以及4500名参与者在四个维度上的摘要评判数据。基于此训练DeliberationJudge模型，使用微调的DeBERTa模型从个体角度评估审议摘要。

Result: DeliberationJudge相比多种LLM评判器更高效且与人类判断更一致。评估18个LLM发现审议摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数立场代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估审议摘要提供了可扩展且可靠的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型推理过程中产生的幻觉，提高模型可靠性。

Method: 通过提示工程系统性地复现不同类型的幻觉，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，采用无监督学习技术分析降维后的表示。

Result: 质心间距离的定量评估显示，幻觉中信息扭曲的严重程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离存在一致相关性。

Conclusion: 即使简单的分类算法也能可靠地区分单个LLM中的幻觉与准确回答，为改进模型可靠性提供了轻量级但有效的框架。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective

### [29] [Let it Calm: Exploratory Annealed Decoding for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05251)
*Chenghao Yang,Lin Gui,Chenxiao Yang,Victor Veitch,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为探索性退火解码（EAD）的新策略，通过在生成过程中从高到低逐渐降低采样温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的探索策略，显著提升强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用的矛盾：高温会降低样本质量，低温会限制发现。需要一种能同时保持样本质量和训练稳定性的有效探索策略。

Method: EAD采用动态温度调度，在生成早期使用高温鼓励语义多样性，随后逐渐降低温度以保持样本质量并使采样分布接近目标策略。

Result: EAD在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下均优于固定温度采样，显著提高了样本效率，且是轻量级即插即用方法。

Conclusion: 将探索与序列生成的自然动态对齐是提升LLM推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于衡量九种亚洲语言中实体文化偏见的基准，包含19,530个手动标注的文化关联实体和2,173个社交媒体上下文，评估显示多语言大模型在亚洲语言中普遍存在文化适应困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准，不清楚LLMs是否在不同非西方语言中也表现出文化偏见，特别是对亚洲文化实体的处理能力。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含手动标注的文化关联实体和自然上下文，评估四个多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都表现出文化适应困难，不同模型家族持有不同的文化偏见，在亚洲语言中的上下文理解能力不足导致实体抽取性能差异。

Conclusion: 多语言LLMs在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见和适应困难，需要更多文化相关数据来改善跨文化表现。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

*Yining She,Daniel W. Peterson,Marianne Menglin Liu,Vikas Upadhyay,Mohammad Hossein Chaghazardi,Eunsuk Kang,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现基于LLM的安全护栏模型在检索增强生成(RAG)场景下存在上下文鲁棒性问题，插入良性文档会改变约11%的输入护栏和8%的输出护栏判断，使其不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，确保LLM系统安全成为迫切需求。外部LLM护栏模型是流行的安全筛查方案，但它们本身容易受到数据分布变化的影响，特别是在RAG场景中。

Method: 以RAG为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析插入良性文档到护栏上下文中的影响，并分别考察检索文档、用户查询和LLM生成响应等组件的作用。

Result: 插入良性文档会显著改变护栏模型的判断，输入护栏和输出护栏分别有约11%和8%的案例受到影响。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 当前护栏模型存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了WeatherArchive-Bench基准，用于评估历史天气档案上的检索增强生成系统，包含检索和评估两个任务，揭示了现有方法在处理历史术语和社会脆弱性概念时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会应对极端天气的叙述，但规模庞大、质量嘈杂且语言古老，难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案新闻片段中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（评估LLM对社会脆弱性和韧性指标的分类能力）两个任务。

Result: 实验显示稠密检索器在处理历史术语时表现不佳，LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为残差相似度(RS)的新方法，通过神经网络补充可解释特征系统来提高性能，同时保持可解释性。该方法使用神经网络预测可解释系统相似度预测的误差残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者身份验证系统不仅需要高准确率，还需要可解释的解决方案。神经方法虽然准确率高，但其表示缺乏直接可解释性，且LLM预测无法忠实解释。需要既能提高性能又能保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 残差相似度(RS)方法：使用神经网络预测可解释系统相似度预测的误差残差。作者身份验证本质上是相似性任务，该方法通过神经网络补充可解释特征系统。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能达到最先进作者身份验证模型的性能水平，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释性程度。

Conclusion: 残差相似度方法成功地在提高作者身份验证系统性能的同时保持了可解释性，解决了神经方法缺乏直接可解释性的问题。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了克服Transformer注意力机制二次复杂度瓶颈的各种方法，包括亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构，评估这些方法是否可能挑战纯注意力Transformer的主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度随着上下文长度增加成为显著瓶颈，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 系统性地调查和分析了四种主要方法：亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构，从计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果、基本限制等角度进行批判性分析。

Result: 通过综合分析发现，这些替代方法在特定场景下显示出潜力，但纯注意力Transformer的主导地位短期内仍难以被完全取代。

Conclusion: 虽然存在多种有前景的替代方案来克服Transformer的复杂度瓶颈，但纯注意力Transformer的统治地位在可预见的未来仍将持续，需要进一步研究来平衡效率和性能。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 即使大语言模型能够完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会随着输入长度增加而显著下降，这揭示了输入长度本身对模型性能的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在长上下文任务中性能下降的根本原因，挑战了传统认为性能下降仅由检索失败导致的观点。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLM进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记等方法。

Result: 实验显示即使完美检索，模型性能仍下降13.9%-85%；提出通过让模型复述检索证据将长上下文任务转化为短上下文任务的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，独立于检索质量；提出的简单缓解策略在GPT-4o上可提升性能达4%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

TL;DR: 提出跨语言患者压力表达图(CL-PDE)框架，通过图方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，解决印度心理健康沟通中的语言和文化多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且在当前临床NLP中代表性不足。现有健康本体和心理健康资源以英语或西方文化为中心，无法充分代表印度语言中患者痛苦表达。

Method: 使用基于图的方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 提出的CL-PDE框架能够解决医疗沟通中的关键差距，将AI系统建立在文化有效的表征基础上。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言环境中的心理健康护理提供了更具包容性和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Motivation: ICU护理文档存在术语不一致、风格非正式、缺乏标准化等问题，在心衰护理中尤为关键

Method: 应用直接偏好优化(DPO)方法，使用MIMIC-III数据库中的8,838条心衰护理记录和21,210个偏好对来微调Mistral-7B模型

Result: BLEU从0.173提升至0.318(+84%)，BERTScore从0.828提升至0.891(+7.6%)，专家评分在准确性、完整性、逻辑一致性、可读性和结构清晰度方面均有显著提升

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型符合专家标准，支持隐私保护的AI辅助文档记录，减轻管理负担并提高ICU患者安全

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够有效自动化结构工程中的有限元建模任务，显著提高工作流程效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Filtered Distillation框架，将LLM生成的推理视为信任信号而非监督信号，通过三个无监督信任指标筛选高质量样本用于专利分类训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的推理常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接用作监督会传播噪声并影响训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个无监督信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，集成统一信任分数来加权训练样本。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 为专利分析中利用推理感知信任指标建立了可靠范式，能够有效提升分类性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 基于图谱监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中具有显著优势，能够有效捕捉不同智能体的互补优势，实现更优性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TensorBLEU是一个专为GPU优化的BLEU指标实现，通过完全向量化和内存高效计数机制，在训练过程中提供13-40倍的加速，解决了传统BLEU评估的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NLP模型规模庞大，但评估工具往往成为计算瓶颈，特别是在训练过程中的实时评估（如强化学习中的逐句奖励信号），需要直接在GPU上高效处理token ID批次。

Method: 设计完全向量化的GPU加速BLEU计算，使用torch.unique创建紧凑的批次特定n-gram字典，避免传统哈希向量化的高内存成本，适用于大词汇量模型。

Result: 在消费级GPU（NVIDIA T4）上实现超过13倍加速，在数据中心级硬件（NVIDIA A100）上超过40倍加速，将显著瓶颈转化为训练循环中的可忽略部分。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU作为"Token-ID BLEU"开发工具，为RL模型微调等研究领域提供了强大的加速工具，已开源实现。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过为规划基准添加细粒度自然语言约束，发现约束显著降低了LLMs的规划性能，并挑战了其对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用和简化的环境规范，可能高估LLMs的规划能力并带来下游任务的安全问题。

Method: 在广泛使用的规划基准上添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义的类别，并在多个模型、形式语言、方法和数据集上进行评估。

Result: 引入约束后，性能一致下降一半，且对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性受到显著挑战。

Conclusion: 需要更现实的约束评估来准确衡量LLMs的规划能力，避免在安全关键应用中高估其性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在领域特定应用（如职位匹配）中面临质量不高、推理延迟大、可扩展性差等问题，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用多目标建模（编码器用于分类，解码器用于解释），结合数据和logit层面的多级知识蒸馏，从强教师模型向多个下游模型传递知识。

Result: 实验结果显示LANTERN显著提升了职位匹配和解释的任务指标，在线评估表明增加了0.24%的申请率和0.28%的合格申请率。

Conclusion: LANTERN框架成功解决了LLM在领域特定任务中的部署问题，通过知识蒸馏和后期训练技术实现了高质量的职位匹配服务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

TL;DR: PDS是一种无需指令的动态引导方法，通过聚类激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时根据输入生成特定引导向量来增强LLM推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依赖显式推理指令或静态引导方法，缺乏自适应、无需指令的推理增强方法

Method: 通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时将输入隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定引导向量

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上持续提升准确率，即使CoT被显式抑制以提升成本效益时增益仍然存在

Conclusion: 基于原型的动态引导是增强LLM推理的轻量级替代方案，能够强化潜在推理过程而非仅引发表面行为改变

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息过载问题，需要一种系统的记忆模块设计原则来提升阅读理解能力。

Method: 开发CAM原型系统，采用增量重叠聚类算法构建结构化记忆，支持层次化摘要和在线批量集成，推理时自适应激活查询相关信息。

Result: 在问答、查询摘要和声明验证等长文本理解任务中，CAM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论的记忆系统设计为LLM长文档理解提供了更稳健高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，需要更有效的知识提取和推理方法来处理全局感知和可操作的维护任务，传统文本块RAG在系统级洞察方面存在局限。

Method: 使用OMIn数据集构建QA基准，建立结构化知识图谱并集成到检索增强生成(RAG)流程中，评估本地可部署的LLMs并使用更强模型作为评判者。

Result: KEO显著改善了全局感知能力，能够揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务上仍然有效。

Conclusion: 知识图谱增强的LLMs在安全、特定领域的QA中具有前景，在高风险推理中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

### [49] [H1B-KV: Hybrid One-Bit Caches for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05529)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存内存减少70倍至60MB，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码在大型语言模型中需要缓存不断增长的KV对，使得长上下文推理成为内存受限问题。现有方法如量化缓存、令牌驱逐或键的二进制草图往往只压缩部分组件或丢弃上下文信息，无法提供完整解决方案。

Method: 提出H1B-KV混合压缩方案：使用1位二进制草图表示键向量，支持硬件友好的位注意力计算；对值向量采用4位量化。通过轻量级微调实现压缩后的性能保持。

Result: 7B参数LLM处理8k令牌上下文仅需60MB缓存内存（减少70倍）。在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（数学推理GSM8K、多任务理解MMLU、代码生成HumanEval）上匹配全精度性能，在质量每字节指标上显著优于KIVI、SparseLLM和Loki等方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV为在内存受限环境中部署LLM提供了稳健解决方案，通过全面压缩KV缓存显著降低内存需求而不牺牲上下文信息。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 自博弈偏好优化已成为对齐大语言模型的重要范式，但作为核心组件的提示作用尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自博弈偏好优化过程。

Method: 使用提示N个采样响应的平均奖励作为难度代理指标，分析不同难度提示在自博弈优化中的表现差异，并探索通过选择性移除困难提示来缓解其负面影响。

Result: 困难提示的自博弈优化性能显著劣于简单提示；将困难提示纳入训练无法提升反而轻微降低整体性能；模型容量增加能缩小难度差距；选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可提升整体性能。

Conclusion: 提示难度是自博弈偏好优化中的关键因素，困难提示会阻碍优化过程，但可通过策略性筛选提示来缓解这一问题，模型容量也影响难度效应。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Result: 在相同压缩水平下获得更好的精度，同时实现推理加速

Conclusion: PGSVD为零样本压缩提供了理论指导，有效平衡了模型压缩与性能保持

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Conclusion: EvoPresent通过统一的叙事、美学感知设计和虚拟角色展示交付，解决了学术论文展示生成中的关键挑战，为自动化展示生成提供了有效的自我改进框架。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态交互规划有效扩展搜索空间并确保推理过程系统收敛，展现了在多跳推理任务中增强语言代理的潜力和通用性

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Result: 在三个长视野代理任务中达到最先进性能，训练成本比基于RL的基线降低8倍

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种无需人工努力或额外训练数据的高效有效解决方案，显著提升代理规划能力

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

Motivation: 隐式属性值提取在电子商务中至关重要，但由于多维数据的复杂性和视觉-文本理解差距，现有MLLM方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，多个MLLM智能体通过多轮辩论相互验证和更新响应，迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在ImplicitAVE数据集上的实验表明，即使少量辩论轮次也能显著提升准确性，特别是对初始性能较低的属性。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略能够有效解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电子商务中的隐式AVE提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Abstract: Despite representing nearly one-third of the world's languages, African
languages remain critically underserved by modern NLP technologies, with 88\%
classified as severely underrepresented or completely ignored in computational
linguistics. We present the African Languages Lab (All Lab), a comprehensive
research initiative that addresses this technological gap through systematic
data collection, model development, and capacity building. Our contributions
include: (1) a quality-controlled data collection pipeline, yielding the
largest validated African multi-modal speech and text dataset spanning 40
languages with 19 billion tokens of monolingual text and 12,628 hours of
aligned speech data; (2) extensive experimental validation demonstrating that
our dataset, combined with fine-tuning, achieves substantial improvements over
baseline models, averaging +23.69 ChrF++, +0.33 COMET, and +15.34 BLEU points
across 31 evaluated languages; and (3) a structured research program that has
successfully mentored fifteen early-career researchers, establishing
sustainable local capacity. Our comparative evaluation against Google Translate
reveals competitive performance in several languages while identifying areas
that require continued development.

### [57] [Code-Switching In-Context Learning for Cross-Lingual Transfer of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05678)
*Haneul Yoo,Jiho Jin,Kyunghyun Cho,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)方法，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，缓解大语言模型依赖英语作为潜在表征的翻译障碍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备多语言能力，但其推理过程依赖将非英语内容内部翻译为英语，当翻译失败时性能急剧下降，限制了LLM应用的包容性。现有跨语言上下文学习方法主要使用单语演示，往往无法缓解反而强化了这一翻译障碍。

Method: CSICL是一种提示策略，在演示和指令中控制性地从目标语言渐进转换到英语，为英语推理过程提供显式支架，作为隐式语言桥梁增强跨语言对齐。

Result: 在4个LLM、6个数据集和10种语言的广泛实验中，CSICL始终优于跨语言上下文学习基线方法，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源设置下提升更显著(目标语言14.7%，未见语言5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码转换是一种原则性且稳健的方法，可在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动LLM向更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于结果监督强化学习的Agentic RAG方法存在探索效率低、奖励信号稀疏和全局奖励反馈模糊等问题，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: 将RAG建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合决策与执行，引入高效剪枝策略优化数据扩展，进行全面的过程级策略优化。

Result: 在六个数据集上平均绝对性能提升6.2%，显著超越现有基线方法，剪枝策略使数据构建效率提升近6倍。

Conclusion: DecEx-RAG为过程监督的RAG训练提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务处理中的能力。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is
available at https://github.com/sdsxdxl/DecEx-RAG.

Motivation: 为天文观测设施创建统一的多源映射，以支持名称解析API和国际虚拟天文台联盟词汇表。

Method: 结合可调整标准的评分系统和NLP技术（词袋方法、序列方法和表面方法），从八个语义资源中提取实体，并使用LLM验证映射建议。

Result: 生成了包含多源同义词集的映射，每个实体只有一个标准化标签。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成可信且符合FAIR原则的验证同义词对，将用于名称解析API和天文本体门户平台。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，通过结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，使用字典和列稀疏系数矩阵表示权重，提供更灵活的子空间表示，在保持模型准确性的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于刚性，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略来平衡计算效率和模型保真度。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，每个权重矩阵用密集字典和列稀疏系数矩阵表示，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重建误差，支持稀疏-密集矩阵乘法和后训练量化。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，20-50%压缩比下，在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文推导了非渐近谱带，通过对齐度、温度和批次谱来约束InfoNCE梯度范数的平方，恢复了1/τ²定律，并在合成数据和ImageNet上紧密跟踪批次平均梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究InfoNCE损失的梯度特性，特别是如何通过批次谱分析来优化对比学习训练过程，提高训练效率和性能。

Method: 使用有效秩作为各向异性代理，设计了谱感知批次选择方法，包括快速贪心构建器，并在ImageNet-100和CIFAR-10上进行实验验证。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1精度的时间减少了15%，在CIFAR-10上显示出类似的增益。批次内白化促进了各向同性，并将50步梯度方差减少了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 谱感知批次选择和批次内白化是优化对比学习训练的有效方法，能够显著提高训练效率和性能，与理论上界相匹配。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要将海量文本数据转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 基于最优传输的信息性注意力方法，改进对参考摘要中关键信息的学习；2. 命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了比先前工作更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争力结果。人工评估也显示在信息性方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息性，进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE层在推理时参数激活的稀疏性，发现大多数神经元激活值接近零，这启发了选择高激活神经元专家的方法。

Method: 提出Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)，在每个专家内部应用简单的top-k选择进行神经元级专家选择，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE仅激活50%的MoE层参数即可匹配传统MoE性能，在相同激活参数数量下持续优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

Motivation: 当前TTS偏好优化方法需要成对的优劣样本，但这种数据在TTS输出中有限，且句子级优化无法实现细粒度的token级发音对齐。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元进行优化，自动提供细粒度的对齐信号，无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提升39%，CER降低54%，为目标token自动分配12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO通过消除配对数据需求并实现token级优化，为TTS系统提供了更数据高效和细粒度的偏好优化方法。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过度强调利用，导致熵崩溃和探索能力下降，形成自我强化的循环，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段rollout：第一阶段生成一半轨迹，然后通过轻量级遗忘步骤暂时抑制这些响应，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域。

Result: 在五个推理基准上，EEPO相比GRPO取得显著提升：Qwen2.5-3B平均增益24.3%，Llama3.2-3B-Instruct增益33.0%，Qwen3-8B-Base增益10.4%。

Conclusion: EEPO通过样本-遗忘机制有效打破自我强化循环，促进更广泛的探索，在RLVR中实现了更好的探索-利用平衡。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Conclusion: Luth为法语小型语言模型设立了新的技术水平，并为未来的法语语言研究提供了强大的基准。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是中小企业缺乏资源和专业知识来起草复杂法律文件，而自动合同生成器的使用效果缺乏实证证据。

Method: 创建并标注多语言基准数据集，捕捉瑞士和欧盟隐私法的关键合规义务，使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模隐私政策合规评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果对三个议题有贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量方面的作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

Motivation: 长上下文模型在处理长序列时容易受到上下文噪声（无关标记）的干扰，这会误导模型注意力并影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出了集成梯度（IG）分数来检测和量化上下文噪声，并设计了上下文去噪训练（CDT）策略，通过减轻检测到的噪声来增强模型对关键标记的关注。

Result: 在四个任务上的广泛实验表明，CDT能显著提升模型对关键标记的注意力，使用CDT训练的8B开源模型达到了50.92的准确率，与GPT-4o的51.00相当。

Conclusion: CDT是一种简单有效的训练策略，能够有效提升长上下文模型在噪声环境下的性能，使其达到与更大模型相当的水平。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

Method: 通过改变有害内容的类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、比例（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000个token），评估LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral等模型对有毒、冒犯性和仇恨言论等有害内容的检测能力。

Result: 所有模型表现出相似模式：在中等有害内容比例（0.25）时性能最佳；随着上下文长度增加，召回率下降；开头位置的有害句子检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 这提供了关于大语言模型如何在长上下文中优先处理和校准有害内容的首次系统性视角，既展示了其新兴优势，也揭示了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

### [71] [The fragility of "cultural tendencies" in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05869)
*Kun Sun,Rong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对LSZ(2025)关于LLMs在不同语言提示下显示文化特定倾向的研究进行批判性重评估，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，而非稳定特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSZ声称LLMs在不同语言提示下会表现出不同的文化倾向（中文提示下更相互依赖和整体性，英文提示下更独立和分析性），但本文作者认为其实验方法、理论框架和结论存在问题，需要进行批判性重评估。

Method: 使用更广泛的LLMs集合和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，检验提示语言对输出的实际影响。

Result: 结果显示提示语言对输出影响极小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码了根深蒂固文化信念的主张。

Conclusion: LSZ报告的"文化倾向"不是稳定的特征，而是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，提示语言对LLMs输出的影响被LSZ夸大了。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈和利用经验回放进行提示重写，显著提升LLM在多轮交互任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多轮交互中表现欠佳，常依赖错误的早期假设且难以追踪用户目标，而对话系统研究表明长期规划对处理交互任务至关重要。

Method: 设计基于强化学习的提示优化框架，仅修改LLM代理的任务指令提示，通过生成逐轮反馈和利用经验回放进行提示重写。

Result: 在text-to-SQL和任务导向对话等多轮任务中表现显著提升，且能泛化到不同的LLM代理，可利用多样化LLM作为元提示代理。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于强化学习的无参数优化方法开辟了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的文化评估基准往往将文化简化为静态事实或同质化价值观，这与人类学将文化视为动态、历史情境化和实践中的概念相冲突。

Method: 引入四部分框架对文化基准进行分类分析，定性检查20个文化基准，识别出六个常见方法论问题，并基于人类学方法提出具体改进方案。

Result: 发现当前文化基准存在将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等问题。

Conclusion: 建议通过融入真实世界叙事和场景、让文化社区参与设计和验证、在情境中而非孤立评估模型，来开发更能准确捕捉模型对复杂文化情境响应的文化基准。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

TL;DR: EvalMORAAL是一个透明的思维链框架，使用两种评分方法（对数概率和直接评分）加上模型作为评判者的同行评审，来评估20个大语言模型的道德对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐表现，揭示模型可能存在的区域偏见，推动文化感知AI的发展。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和PEW全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题）作为基准，结合两种评分方法和模型作为评判者的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应高度对齐（WVS皮尔逊相关系数约0.90），但发现明显的区域差异：西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61（绝对差距0.21），表明存在一致的区域偏见。同行评审标记了348个冲突。

Conclusion: 研究显示在文化感知AI方面取得了实际进展，但跨区域使用仍面临开放挑战，区域偏见问题需要进一步解决。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

TL;DR: 研究表明大语言模型（LLMs）能够在其内部表示中编码数学问题的难度信息，通过线性探测方法可以建模难度级别，并定位到特定注意力头实现难度感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够在内部表示中隐式编码问题难度，这对于自适应推理和高效资源分配至关重要。

Method: 使用线性探测方法分析LLMs最终token表示，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头。

Result: 发现数学问题难度可以在LLMs内部线性建模，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题表现出相反激活模式，且存在token级别的熵和难度感知差异。

Conclusion: LLMs中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持，可减少人工标注成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准测试套件，用于评估LLM在约束规划任务中的表现，特别是随着约束程度增加时的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主要在无约束规划任务上进行测试，但在现实世界中需要遵守约束（特别是安全约束），因此需要评估LLM在约束规划任务中的能力。

Method: 基于现有规划环境施加时间约束，然后将约束问题翻译成自然语言让LLM解决。LexiCon具有可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成时间约束。

Result: 实验表明，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的最先进LLM在规划任务约束程度增加时性能会下降。

Conclusion: LexiCon为评估LLM的约束规划能力提供了系统化基准，揭示了当前LLM在约束规划方面的局限性，且该基准具有未来适应性。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

Motivation: 现有研究使用不同评估方法对LLM的句法学习能力得出矛盾结论，需要澄清哪种评估指标能更准确地反映模型的句法能力。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列范式寄生空位刺激，使用Wilcox风格的wh效应分析系统评估GPT-2模型。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都成功，表明即使在复杂寄生空位环境中也具备对填充语-空位许可原则的稳健知识。

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择对判断LLM的句法能力至关重要，直接最小对比较方法比DiD风格指标提供更清晰的诊断信息。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A单B的LoRA改进架构，通过多专家A矩阵捕获多样化特征，解决了标准LoRA中单一降维矩阵造成的表示瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA依赖单一降维矩阵A作为特征提取器，无法捕获复杂任务所需的多样化信号，这限制了其在下游任务中的适应能力。

Method: 采用多A单B结构，其中多个专家A矩阵不对称地跨层共享以确保参数效率，然后通过层特定的单个B矩阵进行特征整合。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA达到59.62%的平均准确率，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对提升1.84%），可学习参数仅为0.52%。

Conclusion: MASA通过丰富特征适应能力有效提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能，在参数效率约束下实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在精炼的PG刺激物上表现出比基线显著改善的性能。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果，表明先前研究中使用的刺激物特征可能混淆了模型性能的准确评估。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

Motivation: 发现基于强化学习的LLM后训练方法存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制低概率token更新而过度放大高概率token。

Method: 提出ASPO方法，翻转正优势token的IS比率使其与负token的学习动态对齐，并采用软双裁剪机制来稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试中，ASPO显著缓解了早熟收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并超越了基于GRPO的强基线方法的最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析为token级加权在OSRL中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中修正IS的关键重要性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

Motivation: 现有语言模型后训练方法虽然提升了指令跟随能力，但在需要灵活上下文控制和多样输出分布的任务中存在不足，特别是当需要模型根据上下文信息覆盖其先验知识时。

Method: 提出了Spectrum Suite大规模评估资源，包含40多个数据源和90多个任务，用于评估模型在不同分布下的表现。同时提出了Spectrum Tuning后训练方法，使用Spectrum Suite来提升模型的可控性和分布覆盖能力。

Result: 研究发现当前后训练技术虽然有助于激发模型的基础能力，但会损害模型的上下文可控性。Spectrum Tuning方法相比预训练模型和指令调优模型，在可控性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐方面都有改进。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在提升指令跟随能力的同时，保持模型的上下文可控性和分布覆盖能力。Spectrum Tuning提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够平衡这些需求。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上蒸馏竞争性编程技能，研究数据量扩展趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段对相同数据进行微调以分析学习阶段。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)框架，识别了幻觉的承诺层，发现联想路径与上下文路径的冲突是幻觉的内在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型产生幻觉的内在架构原因，理解这种失败模式的根本机制。

Method: 提出DST框架整合可解释性技术，追踪内部语义失败；识别幻觉不可避免的承诺层；基于双过程理论分析联想路径与上下文路径的冲突。

Result: 发现上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关(ρ=-0.863)，表明幻觉是内部语义弱点的可预测结果。

Conclusion: 提供了Transformer架构中幻觉如何、何时及为何发生的机制性解释，揭示了幻觉是内部语义弱点的可预测后果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

*Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出平行分词器框架，通过双语词典对齐不同语言的分词器词汇表，使语义等价词具有一致的索引表示，从而改善多语言模型的跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法在多语言场景下存在语义等价词被映射到不同嵌入表示的问题，限制了跨语言泛化能力，特别是在低资源语言中。

Method: 先单语训练分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译对词汇表进行详尽对齐，确保语义等价词具有一致的索引。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练transformer编码器，在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度任务中均优于传统多语言基线。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置下，平行分词器能有效提升跨语言性能。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CreditDecoding算法，通过利用历史logits信息来加速扩散大语言模型的并行解码，减少冗余迭代，实现4-5倍加速同时保持性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低导致重复掩码，产生冗余迭代，限制了整体加速效果。

Method: 引入Trace Credit概念量化token的收敛潜力，提出CreditDecoding算法，通过融合当前logits和历史Trace Credit来加速正确但置信度不足的token的收敛。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，且与主流推理优化正交，是一个易于集成且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

*Jan Cegin,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Jakub Simko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSE是一种无需人工标注的代理指标，用于选择最佳LLM生成器来产生合成训练数据，特别适用于低资源语言场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言中，人工标注数据稀缺但LLM能生成高质量文本。然而选择最佳LLM生成器很困难，因为外部评估需要昂贵的人工标注，而内部指标与下游性能相关性差。

Method: RoSE方法：在候选生成器的输出上训练一个小模型，然后在所有其他候选LLM生成的合成示例上评估该模型，最终RoSE得分是这个小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比其他内部启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一与人工测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低位宽下的高效KV缓存压缩，在2位量化时达到接近全精度的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低位宽下由于键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，阻碍了有效的码本利用，需要解决KV缓存的内存开销问题。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，使码本能全面覆盖原始数据分布；设计优化的CUDA内核，将计算与反量化融合以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在2位量化下达到与全精度相当的性能，在Llama-3.1-8B上实现大规模自注意力计算2.7倍加速和单批次端到端延迟8.3倍降低。

Conclusion: VecInfer在超低位宽下有效压缩KV缓存，同时保持高性能，为大规模语言模型推理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文推理中通过位置、词汇和自反三种机制绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用其他机制来补偿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何在复杂设置中绑定和检索实体，因为之前的研究发现位置机制在简单场景中有效，但在更复杂情况下可能表现不佳。

Method: 在九个模型和十个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，分析语言模型混合使用位置、词汇和自反三种机制的模式，并开发结合这三种机制的因果模型。

Result: 发现位置机制在中间位置变得嘈杂不可靠，语言模型会补充使用词汇和自反机制，开发的因果模型与真实分布达到95%的一致性，并能推广到更长的开放文本。

Conclusion: 研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了三种机制的混合使用模式及其在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有工作主要采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的实际工作流程，需要评估LLM在多轮交互中生成正确可执行代码的能力。

Method: 构建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次；开发ReCodeAgent框架，将反馈集成到迭代代码生成过程中。

Result: 实验显示，使用GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-V3.1和Gemini 2.5等领先LLM时，更丰富的反馈能带来显著的性能提升，但在复杂研究代码生成方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发适应性强、反馈驱动的LLM代理在科学研究实现中奠定了基础，强调了多轮交互和反馈机制的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing

TL;DR: BanglaTalk是首个针对孟加拉语地区方言的实时语音助手系统，通过方言感知的ASR模型和低带宽设计，解决了孟加拉语方言多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且只关注标准孟加拉语，需要开发支持方言的实时语音助手。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构，使用RTP协议确保低延迟通信；开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，通过在10种孟加拉语方言上微调IndicWav2Vec模型实现。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型性能提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: BanglaTalk通过低带宽使用和最小化延迟，为孟加拉语使用者提供了经济高效且交互性强的实时语音技术，促进了包容性和可访问性。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST模型通过动态聚合语音标记为潜在语音补丁，解决了语音-文本模型中语音序列过长导致的计算不平衡问题，提升了数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音-文本模型存在语音标记序列远长于文本标记的问题，导致计算不平衡、模态对齐效果差和缩放效率低下。

Method: 引入潜在语音-文本变换器(LST)，动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合为潜在语音补丁，作为更高级别的单元来提升计算效率和模态对齐。

Result: LST在语音-语音和文本-文本基准测试中均优于传统方法，在计算控制和数据控制设置下都有显著提升，HellaSwag故事完成任务中语音准确率分别提升6.5%和5.3%。

Conclusion: LST通过潜在语音补丁机制有效解决了语音-文本模型的计算不平衡问题，实现了更高效的数据利用和更陡峭的缩放规律。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取中语言解释缺乏监督的问题，通过促进包含重要关系关键词的输出来提高可解释性。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1) 基于认知科学的文本处理推理机制；(2) 使用新颖奖励函数的强化学习优化过程，该函数旨在同时提高任务准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: CogRE框架通过结合认知结构化推理和强化学习优化，在关系抽取任务中实现了准确性和可解释性的双重提升，为解决少样本关系抽取中的关键挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键型代理需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统性地分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为。

Method: 采用信息论分析方法，研究多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），分析规则格式的句法熵和锚点集中度对注意力熵和指针保真度的影响，并结合动态规则验证架构。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡；动态规则验证架构能渐进提高合规输出的概率。

Conclusion: 锚点设计的原理性和双重执行机制对于保护LLM代理免受提示注入攻击并在演化领域中保持合规性至关重要。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构分离

Method: 提出结构化认知循环(SCL)架构：语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，轻量控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率86.3%，优于基线(70-77%)，目标忠实度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，为扩展研究提供指导

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个结构化阶段，解决LLM在处理复杂规则系统时的推理发散问题，显著优于传统CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本数据而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理发散和关键规则依赖被忽视。现有方法如CoT缺乏结构化规则处理机制且易受错误传播影响。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，受人类专家推理过程启发，将推理机制结构化分为三个阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文环境）、证据收集（基于预定义模板元素提取相关信息并系统验证）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果表明DAT在复杂基于规则的任务中持续优于传统CoT方法。特别值得注意的是，DAT使较小的语言模型能够匹配甚至在某些情况下超过显著更大的LLM的性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面展现出高效性和有效性，通过结构化推理过程解决了LLM在规则处理中的根本限制，为复杂推理任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

TL;DR: 该论文通过算法信息理论重新表述符号接地问题，证明意义接地是一个受信息理论限制的过程，将哥德尔自指性和无免费午餐定理统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个统一的、决定性的理论框架，揭示意义接地的根本信息理论约束。

Method: 使用通用图灵机建模符号系统，将接地定义为信息压缩过程，通过四个理论证明阶段分析接地限制。

Result: 证明纯符号系统无法接地几乎所有可能世界，静态接地系统存在固有缺陷，接地行为不可推断，且任何算法学习过程都无法理解超过其自身复杂度的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断尝试克服自身信息理论限制的开放式过程，接地问题在根本上受到算法信息理论的约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著降低了构建PINN的复杂性和错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题转化为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定的训练流程。现有LLM方法仅解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行并诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示Lang-PINN比竞争基线显著降低误差并提高鲁棒性：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为PINN构建提供了高效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型通过大规模预训练学习高度可迁移的表示，研究表明这些表示在不同架构和模态间具有显著相似性，需要系统研究其表示潜力。

Method: 回顾代表性基础模型和关键度量指标，综合视觉、语言、语音、多模态和神经科学领域的实证证据，分析表示空间的结构规律性和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有强大的表示潜力，能够支持跨模态对齐和统一，但仍存在开放问题和潜在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，现有系统缺乏对数据含义和来源的语义理解能力。

Method: 构建六层框架：感知层、语义标注层、互操作性层、传输层、语义推理层和应用层，包含语义标注算法、同义词识别算法，以及模糊逻辑、D-S理论和贝叶斯网络等不确定性推理方法。

Result: 该框架为物联网数据管理提供了稳健解决方案，确保语义完整性并支持实时知识推理，特别适用于动态环境。

Conclusion: 通过整合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，该框架是推进物联网应用（特别是农业领域）的有价值工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Dramaturge方法，使用分层多LLM代理来改进长篇叙事脚本的质量，通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段实现从粗到细的迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次生成的LLM难以产生高质量的长篇叙事，直接修改会导致局部编辑与整体叙事要求不一致，需要像编剧一样进行有效修订。

Method: 采用分层多LLM代理的分治方法，包括全局审查阶段掌握整体故事线和结构问题，场景级审查阶段识别详细场景和句子缺陷，以及分层协调修订阶段整合结构和细节改进。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法即插即用，可轻松集成到现有方法中改进生成的脚本，通过自上而下的任务流程确保高级策略指导局部修改，保持上下文一致性。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

Motivation: 解决公共卫生紧急事件中大规模半结构化数据分析的挑战，传统方法效率低且泛化能力差。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验证明了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境提供了可扩展的智能人口健康监测解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Motivation: 重复采样能显著提升AI模型的能力和风险，但如何用有限的采样预算准确预测大规模使用时的行为是一个关键问题，这对模型提供商和政府监管机构都很重要。

Method: 1) 发现传统拟合方法存在统计缺陷；2) 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架；3) 提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给困难问题。

Result: 该方法能以较低计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 结合稳健估计和动态采样策略，能够在大规模采样场景下提供更准确的能力和风险评估。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单信号、基于模型的奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 提出混合奖励建模框架，整合模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供明确正确性信号），并引入多维度奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B参数模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习策略优化为MLLM对齐提供了灵活有效的方法，在多个多模态基准测试中表现一致提升。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Motivation: 现有基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或仅限于只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的实际挑战。

Method: 构建包含分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境，支持模型主动澄清、知识检索和错误恢复。

Result: GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务，显示基准的高难度。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT验证了有效交互对于复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性，为方法开发和性能评估提供了全面平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Conclusion: MHA-RAG在准确性和效率方面均优于标准RAG，为少样本领域适应提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

### [111] [Teacher-Student Guided Inverse Modeling for Steel Final Hardness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05402)
*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的钢热处理硬度预测方法，解决多对一映射的逆问题，比传统方法更准确高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢热处理过程中不同输入参数组合可能导致相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练正向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈迭代优化

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上测试，比基线回归和强化学习方法获得更高逆预测精度，且计算时间显著减少

Conclusion: 师生学习框架在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出高效性和有效性

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLMs仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，发现虽然能重新发现可行方案并偶尔提出创造性方法，但问题解决能力脆弱且对问题表述敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs的成功是源于真实推理还是复杂回忆，评估其作为自主科学问题解决者的潜力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025论文提取问题陈述，使用专门的求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善技术解决方案，采用LLM作为评判者范式进行评估。

Result: LLMs能够重新发现可行解决方案并偶尔提出创造性替代方案，但问题解决能力脆弱且高度依赖于问题表述方式。

Conclusion: 提供了关于LLMs作为自主科学问题解决者能力的首个大规模证据，突显了其潜在能力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经符号框架，将答案集编程与基于transformer的学习相结合，用于航空安全报告系统的多标签文本分类，通过规则增强和模糊逻辑正则化减少逻辑违规


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但经常违反专家认为重要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤为令人担忧

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证，采用两种互补方式：规则驱动的数据增强生成逻辑一致的合成样本，以及模糊逻辑正则化在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足

Result: 与强基线相比，该方法提高了微观和宏观F1分数，在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在编程任务中表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足的模型会高估自己的能力，尤其是在不熟悉或低资源编程语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作增多，需要了解AI的认知边界和偏见如何影响共享智能。

Method: 通过分析不同编程语言中模型的置信度和表现，研究AI模型是否表现出类似人类的过度自信模式。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中运行的模型表现出更强的DKE-like偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成比例。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种偏见在不熟悉领域更为明显，揭示了AI认知偏见的普遍性。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型价值对齐的基准测试，通过对比模型在争议性话题正反两面提示下的回答一致性来衡量其价值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规检测，但无法评估模型在面对现实争议问题时是否保持连贯的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型回答的一致性。

Result: 测试显示不同模型在价值对齐方面存在显著差异，安全策略与表达性价值系统之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench为系统比较LLMs如何可靠体现人类价值观提供了可扩展、可复现的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出自动漏洞修复面临两大挑战：缺乏高质量漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证LLM训练中的中间修复过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞的指数级增长迫切需要自动漏洞修复解决方案，但现有基于LLM的方法面临数据质量和过程验证的挑战。

Method: 将漏洞修复建模为序列生成问题，使用LLM直接生成修复方案，但缺乏专门的漏洞推理数据和中间过程验证机制。

Result: 现有方法虽然表现出最先进的性能，但在捕获多样化漏洞修复模式和训练过程验证方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 需要解决漏洞相关推理数据缺乏和中间修复过程验证困难这两个关键挑战，以提升自动漏洞修复的效果。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了数据驱动的决策支持，通过集成学习方法实现了高精度的二氧化碳排放预测。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon

case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、与骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多个目标任务，利用轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应，显著提升VLA模型在未见任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且在未见任务上泛化能力差。为了解决这些问题，需要开发一个高效、可扩展的对齐框架。

Method: 提出Context-Aware Meta Co-Training方法，将多个目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，同时利用结构多样的辅助任务提升域内泛化。采用基于Attentive Neural Processes的轻量级元学习机制，实现从多样上下文的快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，使用6个辅助任务的MetaVLA比OpenVLA在长时程任务上性能提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为实现通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统通过模块化分解工作提供有前景的替代方案。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架和Flow-GRPO算法，将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，通过广播可验证的轨迹级结果来对齐局部规划决策与全局成功。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索、智能体、数学和科学任务上分别获得14.9%、14.0%、14.5%和4.1%的平均准确率提升，甚至超越GPT-4o等更大模型。

Conclusion: AgentFlow展示了在线优化的优势，包括改进的规划能力、增强的工具调用可靠性，以及随模型规模和推理轮数增加的正向扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性）的能力，并测试这些标签对肌肉骨骼X光片多标签图像分类的影响。

Method: 回顾性研究包括锁骨、肘部和拇指的X光片系列。GPT-4o通过结构化模板标注影像发现为"存在"、"不存在"或"不确定"。为评估标签不确定性的影响，将训练和验证集中的"不确定"标签自动重新分配为"存在"（包容性）或"不存在"（排他性），然后使用ResNet50进行多标签分类。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-Diag是一个云边协同的工业故障诊断框架，利用大语言模型解决数据稀缺和资源受限环境部署问题，在少样本场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业故障诊断面临数据稀缺和大型AI模型在资源受限环境中部署困难的双重挑战。

Method: 采用三层机制：视觉语义协同（跨模态预训练对齐信号特征与LLM语义空间）、内容感知推理（动态构建上下文提示增强诊断准确性）、云边协同（知识蒸馏创建轻量级边缘模型，通过共享决策空间实现在线更新）。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，Syn-Diag显著优于现有方法，特别是在1-shot和跨工况场景下。边缘模型性能接近云端版本，同时模型大小减少83%，延迟降低50%。

Conclusion: Syn-Diag为现代智能诊断提供了一个实用、鲁棒且可部署的范例。

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

first programmable computers, and social simulations soon thereafter, to
today's experiments with large language models. This overview emphasizes the
role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both
through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from
around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the
challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware
of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic
agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the
current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics.
A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to

*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来构建通用推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法，并具有出色的跨模型和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的标注数据。研究发现简单思维链推理与复杂系统性能相当，因此需要深入研究多智能体系统的基本推理单元。

Method: 引入Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，将思维链推广为代理化推理，每个推理步骤由专门模块执行。通过代码空间的树搜索从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹反思进行突变演化。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法，构建的系统在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM作为一种通用推理构建块，可以直接递归使用或作为元编排器的子程序，展示了出色的泛化能力和性能优势。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络的拉格朗日粒子扩散模型(LPDM)模拟器，用于估算大气传输足迹和温室气体浓度，实现1000倍加速并量化不确定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以量化，AI技术为加速传输模拟和量化不确定性提供了双重机会

Method: 使用图神经网络构建LPDM模拟器，采用集成方法估算大气传输足迹、温室气体浓度及其不确定性

Result: 模拟器比NAME LPDM快约1000倍，能重现大规模足迹结构，集成分析揭示了预测误差的空间相关性

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的鲁棒性

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度得分的早期预测方法，使用多模态特征在30-420分钟时间窗口内预测网络迷因的病毒式传播，XGBoost模型在仅30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒式传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。本研究旨在探索使用大规模跨语言数据集早期预测迷因病毒式传播的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度得分的病毒性定义方法，采用时间序列保留训练集防止数据泄露。评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知器等模型，使用包含静态内容和网络特征的综合多模态特征集。

Result: 最佳模型XGBoost在仅30分钟内就达到PR-AUC > 0.52的性能。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的早期病毒性预测基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位在缺乏药物与靶向疾病先验关联时面临挑战，传统知识图谱补全和图神经网络因缺乏可靠信号而表现不佳。

Method: 采用自演进多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，并通过自演进循环分析推理策略。

Result: RareAgent将指示AUPRC提高了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将罕见病药物重定位从被动学习转变为主动推理，显著提升了性能并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Motivation: 约束规划是解决现实世界约束优化问题的重要技术，但相比运筹学模型，CP在基于LLM的自动建模方面关注较少。作者希望构建可信赖的神经符号AI，利用符号求解器的优势。

Method: 在开源LLM基础上进行多指令监督微调，提出约束感知检索模块增强上下文学习能力，集成到带引导自校正机制的思维树框架中。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM成功展示了专门针对约束规划建模的LLM的潜力，为构建神经符号AI系统提供了有效方法，并在工业级任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的无标签过滤方法，用于筛选合成思维链数据，通过模型自身置信度替代外部标签，在生物扰动预测领域取得了优于未过滤数据和接近真实标签训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要真实标签来筛选合成思维链数据，但在生物学等实验数据稀缺的领域成本高昂，需要一种无标签的替代方案。

Method: 使用模型自身的不确定性指标（如自一致性和预测困惑度）来量化置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集，采用逐类过滤和混合不确定性指标。

Result: 过滤后的子集准确率更高，在监督微调中优于未过滤的合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距，并超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是高效创建推理数据集的有力信号，能够在监督成本高的领域实现大型推理模型的训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: DebateQD算法通过辩论式进化优化，相比传统基于真理的优化方法，能够产生更具泛化能力的推理策略，减少训练-测试泛化差距达13.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在优化输出真实答案时容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论式优化在辩论场景中显示出潜力，但尚未与主流基于真理的方法进行系统比较。

Method: 提出DebateQD算法，这是一种最小化的质量-多样性进化算法，通过锦标赛式辩论（两个LLM辩论，第三个LLM评判）来演化不同类别的多样化辩论策略。该方法在单一LLM架构内通过基于提示的策略保持对手多样性。

Result: 在三个模型规模（7B、32B、72B参数）和多个数据集大小上，说服优化的策略实现了高达13.94%更小的训练-测试泛化差距，同时匹配或超过了真理优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力（而非协作寻求真理）能够培养更具可迁移性的推理技能，为提高LLM泛化能力提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，特定任务的训练成本高且不灵活，而纯零样本使用大型语言模型效果欠佳。

Method: 将多变量序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，利用推理型LLM比较查询与示例，生成带置信度的通道级标签，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在9个挑战性UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的设置下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转化为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，且现有基准因符号和规则多样性有限而容易过拟合。需要构建动态、反事实的基准来揭示过拟合并衡量真实推理能力。

Method: 开发MatheMagic系统，在测试时随机生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的语义解释但保持答案可自动验证，评估模型的归纳和演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎问题而非归纳问题，但会回归到标准数学推理。数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，在归纳任务上的微调泛化效果差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Conclusion: 赋权预训练框架为强化学习提供了通用初始化策略，为未来扩展到高维复杂任务铺平了道路。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出了ARISE评估指标，专门用于评估大型推理模型在测试时扩展能力的有效性，包含样本级感知和动态采样机制两个创新点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较和评估不同模型在测试时扩展能力方面的表现，现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: ARISE评估指标包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制（惩罚计算增加但性能下降的负扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减轻准确率波动和token计数不稳定性对评估的影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域对最先进推理模型进行评估，结果显示ARISE能可靠地测量测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ARISE提供了可靠且细粒度的测试时扩展能力测量方法，评估发现Claude Opus相比其他当代推理模型展现出更优越的扩展特性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在安全对齐失效问题，通过机制可解释性分析发现"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在推理过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前最后几个token处拒绝分数急剧下降。通过干预少量注意力头可以显著提升安全性，并提出高效的数据选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具备多步推理能力，但存在令人担忧的安全漏洞，这些漏洞的机制尚未被充分理解。本文旨在通过机制可解释性方法探究为什么安全对齐在推理模型中会失效。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪token位置的拒绝意图，识别出"拒绝悬崖"现象。通过因果干预分析确定对拒绝行为有负面贡献的稀疏注意力头集合，并提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法Cliff-as-a-Judge。

Result: 研究发现仅消融3%的注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下。提出的数据选择方法仅使用1.7%的常规安全训练数据就能达到相当的安全改进效果，展示了安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非本质上不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制。通过机制可解释性分析可以识别关键的安全漏洞，并开发出高效的安全对齐修复方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推断，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同详细程度的推理，但实际子问题难度差异很大，关键步骤需要深入推理，而简单步骤只需简洁处理，这种统一处理方式造成了冗余。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链，对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推断。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且没有影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法进化的科学助手代理，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试的反馈驱动迭代循环，持续改进科学算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法进化（如AlphaEvolve），容易在复杂领域停滞，要么只进行深度研究而不验证，产生不切实际的解决方案。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 集成深度研究与算法进化，包含外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑、系统调试的反馈驱动迭代循环。每个迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等9个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve通过弥合无引导进化与无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了TelecomTS数据集，这是一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，解决了现有公共基准中可观测性数据代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可观测性数据集往往经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了其在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 引入TelecomTS数据集，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和显式尺度信息，支持异常检测、根因分析和多模态问答基准等下游任务。

Result: 基准测试显示，现有最先进的时间序列、语言和推理模型在处理可观测性数据的突然、噪声和高方差动态时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 实验强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性，表明需要能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型来满足实际可观测性应用需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐，解决了传统算法灵活性不足和LLM方法空间推理困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路线推荐算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法虽然灵活但缺乏空间推理能力，无法同时建模路线级和POI级偏好。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后由管理器协调约束智能体、POI智能体和路径优化智能体，最后通过验证智能体确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功连接了语言灵活性和空间结构，能够对路线可行性和用户偏好进行推理，是路线推荐领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时间计算扩展（TTS）策略，包括顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，在深度搜索代理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在某些场景下（如解决数独谜题），验证答案比生成答案要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时间扩展的潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证和选择多个候选输出）策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适量计算资源。

Result: 通过TTS扩展的开源模型在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp上达到54.0%准确率，在GAIA上达到66.0%，与最佳专有模型相当；Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%准确率，大幅超越专有模型。

Conclusion: 测试时间计算扩展，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升深度搜索代理的性能，使开源模型达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.
